<h3>例 6：</h3>

<p>Dear editors,</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind comments on our manuscript entitled “XX 文章名”. We have
carefully revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s comments. Based on the
suggestions, we have made an extensive modification on the revised manuscript.
Detailed revision was shown as follows. The changes to our manuscript within the
document were aslo highlighted by using red colored text.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As to the related articles published in Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,
we have always been reading the latest papers that were published in APJCP. In fact, several high-quality papers arouse us great interest before we drafted our manuscript. From our intensive reading of these papers published in APJCP, we get better understanding of the hotspots in breast cancer research. We also get a
wider view of the regulatory networks that contribute to XXXX. For example, one
paper entitled “XXXX” showed that metastasis-related molecules could be
regulated by microRNAs in human tumor metastasis process. This paper led us to
hypothesize that XXX, a metastasis-associated protein, might also be linked to
microRNA regulations in breast cancer. Hence, this paper provided a novel clue
for us to uncover the mechanisms underlying XXXX cancer metastasis. Based on
all these instructive papers, we have herein added these references to our article in
the revised version (please see P6, Line 15; P12, Line17; P14, Line 21-22; P15,
Line 1-4).</p></li>
<li><p>For the reference format within the article, we are sorry for our incorrect citation
format. And in this revised version, we have checked carefully of all the citations.
All citations within the article were formatted into “Family Name et al., Year” for
over two-author papers, or “Family Name, Year” for only one-author papers.</p></li>
<li><p>For the reference format after the text, we also feel sorry for our carelessness.
Previously, we didn’t notice the special format of APJCP. In the revised version,
we have corrected all the reference formats to meet the requirements of APJCP.
All the detailed corrections could be seen in the Reference section in which
changes were marked by red.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Thank you again for your positive comments on our manuscript. APJCP is an
influential journal which aims to improve our understanding of cancer prevention.
From all the papers published in your journal, readers have been learning a lot.
Hopefully, we could have our article been considered of publication in your
journal. Should there been any other corrections we could make, please feel free
to contact us.</p>
