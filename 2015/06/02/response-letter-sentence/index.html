<div class="entry-content"><p>又总结了一部分万能的开场白，足以体现我们对杂志社编辑和审稿人的尊重。</p>

<p>1、It is with excitement that I resubmit to you a revised version of manuscript “文章题目” for the &ldquo;杂志名&rdquo;. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to revise and resubmit this manuscript. In keeping with my last communication with you, I am resubmitting this revision before the agreed upon deadline, March 16, 2012. I appreciate the time and detail provided by each reviewer and by you and have incorporated the suggested changes into the manuscript to the best of my ability. The manuscript has certainly benefited from these insightful revision suggestions. I look forward to working with you and the reviewers to move this manuscript closer to publication in the 杂志名. （这段拍马屁的写得真长哇，憋不出来的可以参考下）</p>

<p>2、I have responded specifically to each suggestion below, beginning with your own. To make the changes easier to identify where necessary, I have numbered them.</p>

<p>3、I am pleased to resubmit for publication the revised version of 文章在杂志社的编号 “文章题目”. I appreciated the constructive criticisms of the Associate Editor and the reviewers. I have addressed each of their concerns as outlined below. （这样的开场白简单点）</p>

<p>4、Sincerest thanks for your response and reviewers comments on our manuscript. We sincerely apologise for the great time it has taken us to respond to these comments (due to force majeaure with first author), and hope that a revised version of the manuscript will still be considered by 杂志名. We have modified the paper in response to the extensive and insightful reviewer comments. We have added additional explanations for non-haematologists and additional table (Table 1) to fully address the reviewer’s comments. Furthermore we have rewritten sections of the manuscript and we hope that this comply with the referee’s remarks. We will respond to the comments point counter point. （这段挺长的，还就返修时间过长进行了致歉）</p>

<p>6、The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their time and their valuable comments. Before addressing each of the comments below, we would like to make a general remark regarding the intent of the manuscript and the choice of the journal.</p>

<p>We chose &ldquo;XX杂志社&rdquo; because it is an applied journal publishing papers that will help clinical medical physicists perform their responsibilities more effectively and efficiently, and for the increased benefit of the patient. We feel that this journal is appropriate for our manuscript that we intend to be a practical paper which is helpful for a hospital physicist.</p>

<p>We deliberately went into more details in parts of the introduction and the methods section explaining specifics of CBCT, since the target audience might not be interested in the more fundamental papers in other journals covering the topic. We obviously need to quote all sources correctly and will do so at the places where we had missed before. （让我亮瞎眼的拍马屁，想抄的尽管抄）</p>

<p>7、Please find enclosed the response to the comments of reviewers. The manuscript has been carefully revised in response to the reviewers’comments and suggestions; detailed responses to their comments are below. Our reply is in italic font, whereas the reviewers’ specific comments are not italicized. We thank the reviewers for their suggestions, which have significantly improved this m/s.</p>
