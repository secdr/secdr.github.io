    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Little did I know that a Ph.D. in computer science would teach me more about how to write than any other previous experience I’d had.  Indeed, research isn’t only about making new discoveries, but also about expressing those discoveries so that other people can appreciate them and their significance.</p>

<p>Below, I’ll present some thoughts on writing that I’ve picked up over the years and continually aim (and encourage students) to put into practice. I’ll focus on story-telling, presentation, and efficiency: how to write your paper so that it clearly, cleanly, and efficiently tells a good story.</p>

<p>What this post is not about.  At least in this post, I won’t write about grammar—there is too much English grammar to cover in a single post, and there are plenty of good courses one can take to learn grammar.  I also won’t talk about style (common phrases) or usage (e.g., commonly misused words).  For now, my only advice on the topic of learning English grammar and style—both for native speakers and foreigners—is to read daily.  Reading the New York Times, or The Economist are great places to start: the writing is generally of high quality, and you’ll also have something interesting to talk about outside of the lab.  I have the impression that foreign students can tend towards reading their local news from home; that’s understandable, but I would encourage those students to also read periodicals and publications that are written in the style of English that people are used to reading in the Western world (indeed, English in different parts of the world has different tones, styles, idioms, and turns of phrase).</p>

<h3>Why Does Writing Well Matter?</h3>

<p>Writing is part and parcel of the research process.  Writing communicates your research results, and—perhaps contrary to intuition—writing well is even more important when the results that one wants to present are “strong” (after all, if the results are that great, you should want as many people as possible to benefit from understanding them).  But writing isn’t just something that happens at when the research is “done”; rather, writing should occur throughout the course of a research project.  Writing and thinking are tightly coupled—writing is a reflection of our own thoughts, and writing well can actually sometimes clarify our own thinking about a problem and lead us to a solution.</p>

<p>Communicating your results. A research finding or discovery that others cannot understand or appreciate is as good as no discovery in the first place.  A well-written paper with a half-baked idea that people can understand and appreciate will often be accepted to a conference over a paper with a (possibly) stronger result that nobody can understand or appreciate.  Cynics may dismiss this as “unfair”, as “laziness” on the reviewer’s part for not reading the details thoroughly, or as “accepting a paper because it was well-written” (insinuating that the results themselves might not be that strong).  The fact of the matter is that none of this matters: Independently of the quality of the research, the results must be written well, or people will not be able to appreciate the value of your work. Writing well is perhaps one of the most important skills that budding researchers must attain; it is equally important as learning how to conduct the research.</p>

<p>Clarifying your own thinking.  Writing is a reflection of your thinking.  You should never be content with vague language or imprecise descriptions.  Muddy writing often reflects muddy thinking.  An attempt to write down a concept, idea, or solution can actually help you realize that you don’t know what you are talking about!  (And, help you crystallize your thinking.)  You may have had the experience of realizing you don’t understand something as well as you thought you did when someone asks you to explain something and you have trouble.  Writing achieves the same effect: as you attempt to write something down, you may realize that you don’t know why you are working on something, why a particular phenomenon appears, and so forth.  If you don’t force yourself to try to write down your explanations and observations, you may never discover that you don’t know what you’re doing until it’s too late.  Therefore, start writing early in the course of a research project.  Most of the early text you write may not find its way into the final version of the paper, but taking the time to express your ideas on paper can help you crystallize your thoughts and guide your research.</p>

<h3>Tell Me a Story</h3>

<p>Every paper should tell a story.  For a given research result, there are many stories that a paper could tell, and it’s important to think about what the story should be.  This decision should be made early on in the writing process.  The story can be changed later on, to match the strongest results in the paper, or if the context for the research changes (for example, sometimes when working on a research problem, people can find it necessary to re-formulate the problem that they are solving).  But, it’s always good to figure out a story before you go too far down the path.</p>

<p>Determining the Big Picture: Composition and “Flow”. Composition is the structure and flow of your paper writeup, and how individual paragraphs fit together.  When people talk about the “flow” of a piece of writing, they’re talking about composition: how sentences flow together to form paragraphs, how paragraphs flow together to form sections, and how sections flow together to form a paper.  Composition (or “flow”) is the most important aspect of technical writing.  I’ve found that reviewers (and readers) are often forgiving of the occasional grammatical error, especially if a paper was written by non-native English speakers.  The human brain is pretty good at applying “error correction” on grammar.  Correcting “flow”, on the other hand, is extremely hard for a reader to do.  Often, the reader will complain that they “can’t understand where [the paper] is going” and simply give up.  Grammar is also easier to teach (and learn) than composition because there are fixed rules for grammar; composition is more of an art form, and it does involve a bit of intuition.  It involves thinking about the big picture, the story that you want to tell, and how the pieces fit together.  It takes practice to develop intuition for composition, and I’ve found that native English speakers are not necessarily any better at composition than foreigners are (that’s good news for Ph.D. students coming from abroad: the playing field is actually more level than it appears).  Even though composition is a bit of an art form, I’ve found that the following tips can be incredibly helpful for improving flow:</p>

<p>Build the scaffolding before filling in the details. Write sections and topic sentences first.  There is always the temptation to simply jump in and start writing full paragraphs.  This rarely ends well.  Nobody would build a house before first drawing plans.  After the plans comes a foundation, and scaffolding.  Only after the structure is in place can many of the details be filled in.  You should think about writing a paper in the same way: before you can fill in the details, you need to figure out how you want the paper to read when its done; this is your outline.  Start at a high level, by outlining sections.  Once you have an outline of sections, you can begin to slowly fill in more details: outline each paragraph within a section by writing only the topic sentence for the paragraph.  See whether your story makes sense if you read each topic sentence in sequence.  Your “paper” should roughly make sense if you read these topic sentences in sequence (in fact, some reviewers or readers may try to read your paper in exactly this fashion, by skimming topic sentences!).  If reading your topic sentences in sequence doesn’t make sense, something is wrong with your flow.   Determining which topic sentences to write takes a bit of practice, but I find that making a bulleted list of points that you want to include in the section and then clustering those points into related points and topics can help identify the topics you want to cover (and, hence, the topic sentences you want to write).  If you find that the topics you want to cover are not all related to one another, you may need to create additional subsections.  Once you have topic sentences, you can fill in paragraphs, which are groups of closely (and logically) related sentences.  If your sentences aren’t closely related, they don’t belong in the same paragraph and you may need to consider adding a new topic (and topic sentence).
Assess balance and budget pages accordingly.  Once you have your outline, it’s important to budget pages, to figure out how much you plan to write about each topic.  Topics of equal importance or equal relevance should receive “balanced” coverage in the paper.  If your system has two components of relatively equal importance, then the sections covering those components should be of approximately equal length in the paper.  Once you have your outline (from the previous step), you can assess how much space you want to budget for each point.  If some points in a section are more important than others (and hence require more page budget), you can go back and think about how to re-balance your writeup (e.g., by creating a new devoted section to the topic that’s more important, shortening or eliminating the less important point, and so forth).
Follow convention.  Continuing the analogy of a house or building, many designs follow convention: a restroom in a restaurant is often in the back.  A powder room in a house is often near the front door.  These common “design patterns” make life easier for us when we visit a new building or house.  Similarly, your reader is a visitor of your thought process.  A reader who has read (and written) many research papers will similarly expect the structure of your paper to follow certain conventions.  These conventions differ by field: some fields write papers completely in the passive voice, whereas others use active voice.  Some fields prefer related work sections at the beginning of the paper, and others prefer related work at the end.  Some fields expect an introduction that spends time framing the problem, and others expect an introduction that starts with a clear statement of the main result.  There may be an expectation of (or aversion) to mathematics in the main line of the paper.  Within a section, people may expect the introduction to flow in a particular way (in computer science, Jim Kurose’s description of how to write an intro is the best example I’ve seen for writing a conventional paper introduction).
Signpost your paper.  Even if your paper plan and outline make perfect sense to you, the reader doesn’t start out “on the same page” as you.  Even if the builders have built a house completely according to the blueprints, even if the design of the house follows convention, visitors still typically appreciate an explanation of where the bathroom is.  The reader needs instructions for how to read the paper and a clear view for how the paper and story will proceed.  Signposts throughout the paper help the reader understand how the paper is organized.  Examples of signposts include: an outline of the paper at the end of the introduction (“The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.”), a preamble to each section (“In this section, we discuss…”), declarative subsection titles, and (within reason) bold paragraph headings (such as those in this blog post).
Make a Good Impression
A reader forms an impression about your research based on your presentation of the work.  Just as people quickly form first impressions about other people that may be difficult to subsequently correct, your reader will quickly form a first impression of your work based on a quick read of the title, abstract, and introduction and perhaps a quick skim through other parts of the paper.  Therefore, it is important to make a good impression by writing a clear abstract and introduction (and also ensuring that the rest of the paper also is commensurate with the impression that you create).</p>

<p>Spend a lot of time on your introduction; start early.  The introduction summarizes the story of your paper (now, it should be doubly clear why you need a story!) and is the most important part of your paper.  Many people won’t read past the introduction, even if they find the work interesting.  Yet, if people don’t understand your “story” (the problem you’re solving, its importance, and your approach to solving it), they will never make it past the introduction into the details of the paper.  There are two schools of thought for writing the introduction: if you write it first, you ensure that you have a clear story.  If you write it last, then your introduction will clearly reflect the ultimate story and be bolstered by your results.  My advice is to do both.  Writing the introduction is probably the most difficult part of writing the paper, which may come as a surprise to new students.  After all, the introduction is high-level and often doesn’t reflect the nitty gritty details of how difficult that experiment was to run, and how much toil went into writing the system.  To the contrary, distilling your work from those details so that the rest of the world can digest the takeaways—stepping out of the weeds and trying to figure out why your work matters—can take more effort than anything.  The same results can be presented in many different ways, so you will likely need to perform many iterations on your story.  Typically, you can “test” your story out on other colleagues and readers with a draft introduction in parallel with completing the rest of your work.</p>

<p>Write the introduction first—and last. I typically try (and encourage students) to write a draft of the paper’s introduction before writing other parts of the paper.  You will most likely eventually discard this draft completely, since it’s very hard to predict what one should be emphasizing in the introduction before the “meat” of the paper is done.  Yet, writing an early introduction draft allows a researcher to put the work in context, and to argue (1) what the problem is, (2) why it is hard, and (3) why the solution (if it is achieved) will be interesting to readers.  If an introduction draft can’t articulate answers to these questions, even at an early stage in the research, then the work likely needs some focus, as well.  When you write the second version of your introduction (after the rest of the paper is written), you are in a good position to refine your story, making sure that any claims you make are clearly supported by your results and data.  Your results should be stated as clearly and specifically as possible.  You should neither understate your results (which might cause the reader to lose interest and stop reading) or overstate them (which might cause the reader to be annoyed or “let down” when they dig in and find that you don’t deliver on what you’ve promised).</p>

<p>Perform some “landscaping” on your paper.  Your paper should be pleasing to the eye.  Care in preparation of the paper suggests that you also cared about the research itself.   Conversely, if the preparation of the paper is sloppy, how can the reader trust that you were not similarly sloppy in writing code, setting up and running your experiments, and analyzing your results?  Therefore, take some time to make your paper look nice. Here are a few quick tips on “landscaping” your paper.</p>

<p>Eliminate widows.  Section headings at the bottoms of columns or pages look sloppy.  Depending on your word-processing tool, there are good ways to get rid of widows.  In Latex, you can always use a “\vfill” to kick the section heading to the top of the next column.  Similarly, widows on paragraphs (paragraphs that end with a single word on the last line) look sloppy.  Typically you can eliminate such widows by wordsmithing (see below on omitting needless words).  Latex also has macros such as “\widowpenalty” that help ensure that the text layout avoids widows whenever possible.
Place (and create) signposts, figures, and graphs to create whitespace and avoid “walls of text”.  Reading long installments of technical writing is tiring, and seeing a page of uninterrupted technical writing can psychologically tire the reader before they even begin to read.  Create whitespace and take other steps to break up large chunks of text.  Use paragraph headings to break up long strings of text (ensuring that your headings match the topics you’ve outlined, of course).  Try to space figures, tables, and graphs throughout the paper so that most pages have a mix of figures and text.  If you don’t have a figure to break up the text, consider making one.  Often, a table summarizing results can be useful.  Or, you might find that a figure (or block of pseudocode) describes a concept better than a paragraph in your writeup.  Take steps to ensure that your writeup is not a long stream of text.
Check your spelling.  Run a spell checker.  Every word-processing tool has one, and a writeup that is rife with spelling errors reflects carelessness.  Again, if you can’t be bothered to check your spelling, why should a reader trust that you spent time debugging your experiment or code?  While a reader can forgive grammatical errors, especially when the writeup comes from a non-native English speaker, anyone can run a spell checker, so spelling errors simply reflect carelessness.  That said, not all spell-checkers are perfect, and sometimes typographical errors actually manifest as real words; spell checkers won’t catch those, so they should be used only as a first pass.
Make the last page look decent.  If you’ve edited your text down to remove redundancy, you may find that you have some extra space at the end of your paper.  Try to adjust your formatting so that the last page of the paper looks decent.  If your paper is double-column and you end with references, balance the references across the two columns so that both columns are both equally (partially) filled.  Latex has a “\balance” command that you can use to balance the columns on the last page of your writeup.  If you have a bit more time, you can also make small adjustments to margins, space between columns, space around figures, sizes of figures, and so forth to ensure that the last page doesn’t look like you just suddenly decided to stop writing.
Be Efficient
“I’m sorry I have had to write you such a long letter, but I did not have time to write you a short one.” –Blaise Pascal</p>

<p>After you’ve made a good impression, you still need to engage the reader at least long enough to convey your main message.  You should assume that the reader is busy, has a short attention span, and (unlike the situation when they are, say, reading a news article or novel) simply wants to learn what you’ve done as quickly as possible and then move on.  In contrast to writing a novel, your goal is not to hold the reader in suspense or to illustrate your command of vocabulary or literary construction.  Rather, the goal is to transfer information as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Tailor the length of your paper to the information content.  People sometimes feel compelled to stuff a paper to the conference’s or journal’s page limit (after all, if the paper is too short, isn’t there “more work to do”?).  I’ve had a few papers that do fall short of the page limit, although I’ve found that this scenario is the exception rather than the rule (see Blaise Pascal: it takes time to shorten a paper!).   Remember that your goal is to efficiently transfer information. Therefore, economize on words.  Do not add unnecessary sentences, paragraphs, or other content that do not support a topic or point that you’ve explicitly outlined.</p>

<p>Keep words simple and sentences short. The easier it is to read your paper, the more likely a reader will keep reading.  Therefore, don’t make the reader work harder than they have to.  On a sentence level, follow Strunk and White’s most indispensable advice: Omit needless words (e.g., “to” as opposed to “in order to”, “optimizing” instead of “the problem of optimizing”, “This module…” instead of “This is a module that”, “more quickly” instead of “in a shorter time”, “whether” instead of “the question as to whether”).   Avoid padding phrases such as “the fact that” and unnecessary adverbs (e.g., “eliminated” instead of “totally eliminated”, “fast” instead of “very fast”).  Keep words simple (e.g., “use” instead of “utilize”, “new” instead of “novel”), and keep sentences short.</p>

<p>Eliminate redundancy.  Always make at least one (and probably several) editing passes over your paper to cut out redundancy.  You likely (and hopefully) did not write your paper in a linear fashion, and different co-authors may have written different sections or pieces of the paper.  It’s likely that you’ve stated the same point multiple times throughout the paper.  Cutting redundancy takes practice, and it sometimes requires divorcing the editing process from your ego (after all, isn’t that sentence you wrote beautiful?  It’d be a shame to cut it, right?).  If you need help cutting, ask someone else (a co-author or colleague) to help you—they’re not as married to your text as you are.</p>

<p>Be as specific and precise as you can.  Precision is especially important when describing results, and when writing up an experiment or evaluation section.  For example, a good rule of thumb for writing up an evaluation section is:  Would someone be able to reproduce your experiment from your description?  If not, you need to be more clear.  In an evaluation section, clearly state your assumptions; in what context(s) do your results hold?  How general are they?  Clearly describe your evaluation setup, as it sets the context for the results themselves.  What machines did you use to run the evaluation?  What data did you gather to support your conclusions?  What algorithms did you use to analyze the data?  The evaluation setup should read like a recipe.  Someone reading it should be able to reproduce what you’ve done, at least well enough to understand the context of the results.  Similarly, the results should be clearly and precisely described.  Avoid writing sentences such as “This optimization significantly reduced the system’s running time.”  Such vague statements frustrate the reader.  Instead, substitute precise and specific information: “This optimization reduced the system’s running time by 20%”.</p>

<p>Use clear and consistent terminology.  Unclear, vague, and inconsistent terminology is incredibly frustrating and also typically reflects muddy thinking.  If you call something a “node” in one part of your paper, a “host” in another part of the paper, a “client” in another part, and a “machine” in yet another part, people will have absolutely no clue that all of these terms are in fact referring to the same thing.  Before you get too far along in the writing process, clearly define your lexicon.  Defining your terms up front can help clarify your own thinking, by helping you to identify and articulate the important concepts that you will present.  Ultimately, this clarity will be reflected in your writeup.</p>

<h3>Reduction to Practice: Write Every Day</h3>

<p>Writing a technical paper involves clearly presenting a good story, as efficiently as possible.  The above tips should help you compose your story and ensure that it “flows” and ultimately produce a final result that leaves a good impression and communicates your results as efficiently as possible.  But, simply reading this post won’t make you a good writer: putting these tips into practice takes tireless repetition.  Try writing something every day to practice these tips.  Keep a “running draft” of your research paper.  Start a blog and practice composing posts that present shorter and simpler ideas and thoughts than a full research paper.  Keep a diary or notebook.  Ultimately, becoming a good writer requires relentless, daily practice, with continual attention to the above tips.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This document describes several simple, concrete ways to improve your writing, by avoiding some common mistakes. The <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/write-technical-paper.html#other-resources">end of this document</a> contains more resources for improving your writing.</p>

<p>Some people believe that writing papers, <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/giving-talk.html">giving talks</a>, and similar “marketing” activities are not part of research, but an adjunct to it or even an undesirable distraction. This view is inaccurate. The purpose of research is to increase the store of human knowledge, and so even the very best work is useless if you cannot effectively communicate it to the rest of the world. Additionally, writing papers and giving talks will clarify your thinking and thereby improve your research. You may be surprised how difficult it is to clearly communicate your ideas and contributions; doing so will force you to understand them more deeply and enable you to improve them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Know your message, and stay on message</h3>

<p>The goal of writing a paper is to change people&rsquo;s behavior: for instance, to change the way they think about a research problem or to convince them to use a new approach. Determine your goal (also known as your thesis), and focus the paper around that goal.</p>

<p>As a general rule, your paper needs to convince the audience of three key points: that the problem is interesting, that it is hard, and that you solved it. If any of these is missing or unclear, the paper will not be compelling. You&rsquo;ll also need to convince your readers that your contributions are novel. When expressing this, it may be helpful to explain why no one else thought of your approach before, and also to keep in mind how you expect the behavior of readers to change once they appreciate your contributions.</p>

<p>Before you write your paper, you need to understand your audience. Who will read your paper? What are their backgrounds, motivations, interests, and beliefs? What are the key points you want a reader person to take away from your paper? Once you know the thesis and audience, you can determine what points your document should make to achieve its purpose.</p>

<p>For each point in your paper, you need to explain both what and why. Start with what, but don&rsquo;t omit why. For example, it is not enough to state how an algorithm works; you should explain why it works in that way, or why another way of solving the problem would be different. Similarly, it is not sufficient to present a figure and merely help the reader understand what the figure says. You must also ensure that reader understands the significance or implications of the figure and what parts of it are most important.</p>

<h3>Which details to include</h3>

<p>Your purpose is to communicate specific ideas, and everything about your paper should contribute to this goal. If any part of the paper does not do so, then delete or change that part. You must be ruthless in cutting every irrelevant detail, however true it may be. Everything in your paper that does not support your main point distracts from it.</p>

<p>Write for the readers, rather than writing for yourself. In particular, think about what matters to the intended audience, and focus on that. It is not necessarily what you personally find most intriguing.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to focus on what you spent the most time on. Do not write your paper as a chronological narrative of all the things that you tried, and do not devote space in the paper proportionately to the amount of time you spent on each task. Most work that you do will never show up in any paper; the purpose of infrastructure-building and exploration of blind alleys is to enable you to do the small amount of work that is worth writing about. Another way of stating this is that the purpose of the paper is not to describe what you have done, but to inform readers of the successful outcome or significant results, and to convince readers of the validity of those conclusions.</p>

<p>Likewise, do not dwell on details of the implementation or the experiments except insofar as they contribute to your main point. This is a particularly important piece of advice for software documentation, where you need to focus on the software&rsquo;s benefits to the user, and how to use it, rather than how you implemented it. However, it holds for technical papers as well — and remember that readers expect different things from the two types of writing!</p>

<p>The audience is interested in what worked, and why, so start with that. If you discuss approaches that were not successful, do so briefly, and typically only after you have discussed the successful approach. Furthermore, the discussion should focus on differences from the successful technique, and if at all possible should provide general rules or lessons learned that will yield insight and help others to avoid such blind alleys in the future.</p>

<p>Whenever you introduce a strawman or an inferior approach, say so upfront. A reader will (and should) assume that whatever you write in a paper is something you believe or advocate, unless very clearly marked otherwise. A paper should never first detail a technique, then (without forewarning) indicate that the technique is flawed and proceed to discuss another technique. Such surprises confuse and irritate readers. This mistake is often called “leading the reader down the garden path”.</p>

<p>When there are multiple possible approaches to a problem, it is preferable to give the best or successful one first. Oftentimes it is not even necessary to discuss the alternatives. If you do, they should generally come after, not before, the successful one. Your paper should give the most important details first, and the less important ones afterward. Its main line of argument should flow coherently rather than being interrupted. It can be acceptable to state an imperfect solution first (with a clear indication that it is imperfect) if it is a simpler version of the full solution, and the full solution is a direct modification of the simpler one. Less commonly, it can be acceptable to state an imperfect solution first if it is an obvious solution that every reader will assume is adequate; but use care with this rationalization, since you are usually wrong that every reader will jump to the given conclusion.</p>

<h3>Make the organization and results clear</h3>

<p>A paper should communicate the main ideas of your research (such as the techniques and results) early and clearly. Then, the body of the paper can expand on these points; a reader who understands the structure and big ideas can better appreciate the details. Another way of saying this is that you should give away the punchline. A technical paper is not a joke or a mystery novel. The reader should not encounter any surprises, only deeper explanations of ideas that have already been introduced. It&rsquo;s particularly irritating when an abstract or introduction states, “We evaluated the relationship between baldness and beekeeping”, with the key results buried pages later. A better abstract would say, “Male beekeepers are 25% more likely to be bald (p=.04), but there is no statistically significant correlation for female beekeepers.”</p>

<p>The same advice applies at the level of sections and paragraphs. It is a bad approach to start with a mass of details and only at the end tell the reader what the main point was or how the details related to one another. Instead, state the point first and then support it. The reader is more likely to appreciate which evidence is important and why, and is less likely to become confused or frustrated.</p>

<p>For each section of the paper, consider writing a mini-introduction that says what its organization is, what is in each subpart, and how the parts relate to one another. For the whole paper, this is probably a paragraph. For a section or sub-section, it can be as short as a sentence. This may feel redundant to you (the author), but readers haven&rsquo;t spent as much time with the paper&rsquo;s structure as you have, so they will truly appreciate these signposts that orient them within your text.</p>

<p>Some people like to write the abstract, and often also the introduction, last. Doing so makes them easier to write, because the rest of the paper is already complete and can just be described. However, I prefer to write these sections early in the process (and then revise them as needed), because they frame the paper. If you know the paper&rsquo;s organization and outlook, then writing the front matter will take little effort. If you don&rsquo;t, then it is an excellent use of your time to determine that information by writing the front matter. To write the body of the paper without knowing its broad outlines will take more time in the long run. Another way of putting this is that writing the paper first will make writing the abstract faster, and writing the abstract first will make writing the paper faster. There is a lot more paper than abstract, so it makes sense to start with that and to clarify the point of the paper early on.</p>

<p>It is a very common error to dive into the technical approach or the implementation details without first appropriately framing the problem and providing motivation and background. Readers need to understand what the task is before they are convinced that they should pay attention to what you are saying about it. You should first say what the problem or goal is, and — even when presenting an algorithm — first state what the output is and probably the key idea, before discussing steps. Avoid providing information that isn&rsquo;t useful to readers/users. It just distracts from the important content.</p>

<h3>Getting started: overcoming writer&rsquo;s block and procrastination</h3>

<p>Some writers are overwhelmed by the emptiness of a blank page or editor buffer, and they have trouble getting started with their writing. Don&rsquo;t worry! Here are some tricks to help you get started. Once you have begun, you will find it relatively easier to revise your notes or first draft. The key idea is to write something, and you can improve it later.</p>

<p>Start verbally. Explain what the paper needs to say to another person. After the conversation is over, write down what you just said, focusing on the main points rather than every word you spoke. Many people find it easier to speak than to write. Furthermore, getting feedback and giving clarifications will help you discover problems with your argument, explanation, or word choice.</p>

<p>Outline. You may not be ready to write full English paragraphs, but you can decide which sections your paper will have and give them descriptive titles. Once you have decided on the section structure, you can write a little outline of each section, which indicates the subsection titles. Now, expand that into a topic sentence for each paragraph. At this point, since you know the exact topic of each paragraph, you will find the paragraph easy to write.</p>

<p>Stream-of-consciousness notes. Write down everything that you know, in no particular order and with no particular formatting. Afterward, organize what you wrote thematically, bringing related points together. Eventually, convert it into an outline and proceed as above. While writing notes, use phrases/keywords, not complete sentences. The phrases are quicker to write and less likely to derail your brainstorming; they are easier to organize; and you will feel less attached to them and more willing to delete them.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer. Rather than trying to write your entire document, choose some specific part, and write just that part. Then, move on to another part.</p>

<p>Re-use. Find other text that you have written on the topic and start from that. An excellent source is your <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/progress-report.html">progress reports</a> — you are writing them, aren&rsquo;t you? This can remind you what was hard or interesting, or of points that you might otherwise forget to make. You will rarely want to re-use text verbatim, both because you can probably convey the point better now, and also because writing for different audiences or in different contexts requires a different argument or phrasing. For example, a technical paper and a <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/giving-talk.html">technical talk</a> have similar aims but rather different forms.</p>

<p>It is essential that you be willing to delete and/or rewrite your notes and early drafts. If you wrote something once, you can write it again (probably better!). Early on, the point is to organize your ideas, not to create finished sentences.</p>

<h3>Brevity</h3>

<p>Be brief. Make every word count. If a word does not support your point, cut it out, because excess verbiage and fluff only make it harder for the reader to appreciate your message. Use shorter and more direct phrases wherever possible.</p>

<p>Make your writing crisp and to the point. Eliminate any text that does not support your point. Here is one way you might go about this; it is time-consuming but extremely effective. First, examine each section of the paper in turn and ask what role it serves and whether it contributes to the paper&rsquo;s main point. If not, delete it. Next, within each section, examine each paragraph. Ask whether that paragraph has a single point. If not, rewrite the paragraph. Also ask whether that point contributes to the goals of the section. If not, then delete the paragraph. Next, within each paragraph, examine each sentence. If it does not make a single, clear point that strengthens the paragraph, delete or rewrite it. Finally, within each sentence, examine each word, and delete or replace those that do not strengthen their point. You will need to repeat this entire process multiple times, keeping a fresh perspective on the paper.</p>

<p>Some people find it easier to follow this approach bottom-up, first cutting/rewriting words, then sentences, etc.</p>

<h3>Writing style</h3>

<p>Passive voice has no place in technical writing. It obscures who the actor was, what caused it, and when it happened. Use active voice and simple, clear, direct phrasing.</p>

<p>First person is rarely appropriate in technical writing. First person should never be used to describe the operation of a program or system. It is only appropriate when discussing something that the author of the paper did manually. (And recall that your paper should not be couched as a narrative.) It is confusing to use “we” to mean “the author and the reader” or “the paper” (“In this section, we &hellip;”) or even “the system being described” (“we compute a graph” makes it sound like the authors did it by hand). As a related point, do not anthropomorphize computers: they hate it. Anthropomorphism, such as “the program thinks that &hellip;”, is unclear and vague.</p>

<p>Avoid puffery, self-congratulation, and value judgments: give the facts and let the reader judge.</p>

<p>Do not use words like “obviously” or “clearly”, as in “Obviously, this Taylor series sums to π.” If the point is really obvious, then you are just wasting words by pointing it out. And if the point is not obvious to readers who are not intimately familiar with the subject matter the way you are, then you are offending readers by insulting their intelligence, and you are demonstrating your own inability to communicate the intuition.</p>

<p>Prefer singular to plural number. In “sequences induce graphs”, it is not clear whether the two collections are in one-to-one correspondence, or the set of sequences collectively induces a set of graphs; “each sequence induces a graph” avoids this confusion. Likewise, in “graphs might contain paths”, it is unclear whether a given graph might contain multiple paths, or might contain at most one path.</p>

<p>When describing an experiment or some other action that occurred in the past, use past tense. For example, the methodology section should not say “We run the program”, but “We ran the program”. However, it would be correct to say “Our methodology was to run the program”, where you are using the infinitive “to run”. When describing the paper itself, use present tense. “This paper shows that &hellip;”. The reason for this is that the reader is experiencing the paper in real time; the paper is like a conversation between the authors and the reader.</p>

<p>Avoid gratuitous use of the future tense “will &hellip;”, as in, “switching the red and green wires will cause the bomb to explode”. Instead, use the shorter and more direct “switching the red and green wires causes the bomb to explode”.</p>

<p>In a 3-or-more-element list, it&rsquo;s better to put serial comma between each of the items (including the last two), for clarity. As a simple example of why, consider this 3-element grocery list written without the clarifying last comma: “milk, macaroni and cheese and crackers”. It&rsquo;s not clear whether that means { milk, macaroni and cheese, crackers } or { milk, macaroni, cheese and crackers }. As another example, “I would like to thank my parents, Rene Descartes and Ayn Rand,” suggests rather unusual parentage, whereas “I would like to thank my parents, Rene Descartes, and Ayn Rand,” shows a debt to four people. I&rsquo;ve seen real examples that were even more confusing than these.</p>

<p>Some of the suggestions in this document are about good writing, and that might seem secondary to the research. But writing more clearly will help you think more clearly and often reveals flaws (or ideas!) that had previously been invisible even to you. Furthermore, if your writing is not good, then either readers will not be able to comprehend your good ideas, or readers will be (rightly) suspicious of your technical work. If you do not (or cannot) write well, why should readers believe you were any more careful in the research itself? The writing reflects on you, so make it reflect well.</p>

<h3>Figures</h3>

<p>Use figures! Different people learn in different ways, so you should complement a textual or mathematical presentation with a graphical one. Even for people whose primary learning modality is textual, another presentation of the ideas can clarify, fill gaps, or enable the reader to verify his or her understanding. Figures can also help to illustrate concepts, draw a skimming reader into the text (or at least communicate a key idea to that reader), and make the paper more visually appealing.</p>

<p>It is extremely helpful to give an example to clarify your ideas: this can make concrete in the reader&rsquo;s mind what your technique does (and why it is hard or interesting). A running example used throughout the paper is also helpful in illustrating how your algorithm works, and a single example permits you to amortize the time and space spent explaining the example (and the reader&rsquo;s time in appreciating it). It&rsquo;s harder to find or create a single example that you re-use throughout the paper, but it is worth it.</p>

<p>A figure should stand on its own, containing all the information that is necessary to understand it. Good captions contain multiple sentences; the caption provides context and explanation. For examples, see magazines such as Scientific American and American Scientist. Never write a caption like “The Foobar technique”; the caption should also say what the Foobar technique is, what it is good for, or how it works. The caption may also need to explain the meaning of columns in a table or of symbols in a figure. However, it&rsquo;s even better to put that information in the figure proper; for example, use labels or a legend. When the body of your paper contains information that belongs in a caption, there are several negative effects. The reader is forced to hunt all over the paper in order to understand the figure. The flow of the writing is interrupted with details that are relevant only when one is looking at the figure. The figures become ineffective at drawing in a reader who is scanning the paper — an important constituency that you should cater to!</p>

<p>As with naming, use pictorial elements consistently. Only use two different types of arrows (or boxes, shading, etc.) when they denote distinct concepts; do not introduce inconsistency just because it pleases your personal aesthetic sense. Almost any diagram with multiple types of elements requires a legend (either explicitly in the diagram, or in the caption) to explain what each one means; and so do many diagrams with just one type of element, to explain what it means.</p>

<p>I am not fond of having many different types of figures in a paper — some labeled “figure”, others labeled “table” or “graph” or “picture”. This makes it very hard to find “table 3”, which might appear after “figure 7” but before “freehand drawing 1”. It&rsquo;s best to simply call them all figures and number them sequentially; the body of each figure can be a table, a graph, a drawing, or whatever.</p>

<h3>Computer program source code</h3>

<p>Your code examples should either be real code, or should be close to real code. Never use synthetic examples such as procedures or variables named foo or bar. Made-up examples are much harder for readers to understand and to build intuition regarding. Furthermore, they give the reader the impression that your technique is not applicable in practice — you couldn&rsquo;t find any real examples to illustrate it, so you had to make something up.</p>

<p>Any boldface or other highlighting should be used to indicate the most important parts of a text. In code snippets, it should never be used to highlight syntactic elements such as “public” or “int”, because that is not the part to which you want to draw the reader&rsquo;s eye. (Even if your IDE happens to do that, it isn&rsquo;t appropriate for a paper.) For example, it would be acceptable to use boldface to indicate the names of procedures (helping the reader find them), but not their return types.</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>

<p>Give each concept in your paper a descriptive name to make it more memorable to readers. Never use terms like “approach 1”, “approach 2”, or “our approach”, and avoid acronyms when possible. If you can&rsquo;t think of a good name, then quite likely you don&rsquo;t really understand the concept. Think harder about it to determine its most important or salient features.</p>

<p>It is better to name a technique (or a paper section, etc.) based on what it does rather than how it does it.</p>

<p>Use terms consistently and precisely. Avoid “elegant variation”, which uses different terms for the same concept, to avoid boredom on the part of the reader or to emphasize different aspects of the concept. While elegant variation may be appropriate in poems, novels, and some essays, it is not acceptable in technical writing, where you should clearly define terms when they are first introduced, then use them consistently. If you switch wording gratuitously, you will confuse the reader and muddle your point; the reader of a technical paper expects that use of a different term flags a different meaning, and will wonder what subtle difference you are trying to highlight. Thus, don&rsquo;t confuse the reader by substituting “program”, “library”, “component”, “system”, and “artifact”, nor by conflating “technique”, “idea”, “method” and “approach”, nor by switching among “program”, “code”, and “source”. Choose the best word for the concept, and stick with it.</p>

<p>Do not use a single term to refer to multiple concepts. If you use the term “technique” for every last idea that you introduce in your paper, then readers will become confused. This is a place that use of synonyms to distinguish concepts that are unrelated (from the point of view of your paper) is acceptable. For instance, you might always use “phase” when describing an algorithm but “step” when describing how a user uses a tool.</p>

<p>When you present a list, be consistent in how you introduce each element, and either use special formatting to make them stand out or else state the size of the list. Don&rsquo;t use, “There are several reasons I am smart. I am intelligent. Second, I am bright. Also, I am clever. Finally, I am brilliant.” Instead, use “There are four reasons I am smart. First, I am intelligent. Second, I am bright. Third, I am clever. Fourth, I am brilliant.” Especially when the points are longer, this makes the argument much easier to follow. Some people worry that such consistency and repetition is pedantic or stilted, or it makes the writing hard to follow. There is no need for such concerns: none of these is the case. It&rsquo;s more important to make your argument clear than to achieve “elegant variation” at the expense of clarity.</p>

<p>Choose good names not only for the concepts that you present in your paper, but for the document source file. Don&rsquo;t name the file after the conference to which you are submitting (the paper might be rejected) or the year. Even if the paper is accepted, such a name won&rsquo;t tell you what the paper is about when when you look over your source files in later years. Instead, give the paper or its folder/directory a name that reflects its content.</p>

<p>Here is a piece of advice that is specific to computing: do not use the vague, nontechnical term “bug”. Instead, use one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependability">standard terms</a> fault, error, or failure. A fault is an underlying defect in a system, introduced by a human. A failure is a user-visible manifestation of the fault. In other circumstances, “bug report” may be more appropriate than “bug”.</p>

<h3>Numbers and measurements</h3>

<p>Use a consistent number of digits of precision. If the measured data are 1.23, 45.67, and 891.23, for example, you might report them as 1.23, 45.7, and 891, or as 1.2, 46, and 890, or as 1, 50, and 900. Use an appropriate number of digits of precision that reflects the measurement process. The 3rd or 4th digit of precision is rarely accurate and generalizable; if you don&rsquo;t have confidence in it, omit it. Keep in mind the message you wish to convey to readers — too many digits of precision, or other irrelevant details, can distract readers from the larger trends and the big picture. And, including an inappropriate number of digits of precision can cast suspicion on all of your results, by giving readers the impression that you are statistically naive. If you do any computations such as ratios, you should internally use the full precision of your actual measurements, but your paper will report only a limited number of digits of precision. If a measurement is exact, such as a count of items, then it can be acceptable to give the entire number even if it has many digits; by contrast, timings and other inexact measurements should always be reported with a limited number of digits of precision.</p>

<p>Do not confuse relative and absolute measurements. For instance, suppose your medicine cures 30% of patients, and the placebo cures 25% of patients. You could report that your medicine&rsquo;s cure rate is .3, the placebo&rsquo;s cure rate is .25, and your medicine&rsquo;s cure rate is either .05 greater or 20% greater. (Other correct, but less good, ways to say the same thing are that it cures cures 20% more, 120% as many, or 1.2 times as many patients.) It would be inaccurate to state that your medicine cures 5% more patients or your medicine cures 120% more patients. Just as you need to correctly use “120% more” versus “120% as many”, you need to correctly use “3 times faster than” versus “3 times as fast as”. A related, also common, confusion is between “3 times faster than and 3 times as fast as”. And, “2 times fewer” makes absolutely no sense. I would avoid these terms entirely. “Half as many” is a much better substitute for “2 times fewer”.</p>

<p>Given the great ease of misunderstanding what a percentage means or what its denominator is, I try to avoid percentages and focus on fractions whenever possible, especially for base measurements. For comparisons between techniques, percentages can be acceptable. Avoid presenting two different measurements that are both percentages but have different denominators.</p>

<h3>Processing data</h3>

<p>Your paper probably includes tables, bibliographies, or other content that is generated from external data. Your paper may also be written in a text formatting language such as LaTeX. In each of these cases, it is necessary to run some external command to create some of the content or to create the final PDF.</p>

<p>All of the steps to create your final paper should be clearly documented — say, in comments or in a notes file that you maintain with the paper — and, preferably, should be automated so that you only have to run one command that collects all the data, creates the tables, and generates the final PDF.</p>

<p>If you document and automate these steps, then you can easily regenerate the paper when needed. This is useful if you re-run experiments or analysis, or if you need to defend your results against a criticism by other researchers. If you leave some steps manual, then you or your colleagues are highly likely to make a mistake (leading to a scientific error) or to be unable to reproduce your results later.</p>

<p>One good way to automate these tasks is by writing a program or creating a script for a build system such as Make or Ant.</p>

<h3>Related work</h3>

<p>A related work section should not only explain what research others have done, but in each case should compare and contrast that to your work and also to other related work. After reading your related work section, a reader should understand the key idea and contribution of each significant piece of related work, how they fit together (what are the common themes or approaches in the research community?), and how your work differs. Don&rsquo;t write a related work section that is just a list of other papers, with a sentence about each one that was lifted from its abstract, and without any critical analysis nor deep comparison to other work.</p>

<p>Unless your approach is a small variation on another technique, it is usually best to defer the related work to the end of the paper. When it comes first, it gives readers the impression that your work is rather derivative. (If this is true, it is your responsibility to convey that clearly; it it is not true, then it&rsquo;s misleading to intimate it.) You need to ensure that readers understand your technique in its entirety, and also understand its relationship to other work; different orders can work in different circumstances.</p>

<p>Just as you should generally explain your technique first, and later show relationships with other work, it is also usually more effective to defer a detailed discussion of limitations to a later section rather than the main description of your technique. You should be straightforward and honest about the limitations, of course (do mention them early on, even if you don&rsquo;t detail them then), but don&rsquo;t destroy the coherence of your narrative or sour the reader on your technique.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>Get feedback! Finish your paper well in advance, so that you can improve the writing. Even re-reading your own text after being away from it can show you things that you didn&rsquo;t notice. An outside reader can tell you even more.</p>

<p>When readers misunderstand the paper, that is always at least partly the author&rsquo;s fault! Even if you think the readers have missed the point, you will learn how your work can be misinterpreted, and eliminating those ambiguities will improve the paper.</p>

<p>Be considerate to your reviewers, who are spending their time to help you. Here are several ways to do that.</p>

<p>As with submission to conferences, don&rsquo;t waste anyone&rsquo;s time if there are major flaws. Only ask someone to read (a part of) your paper when you think you will learn something new, because you are not aware of serious problems. If only parts are ready, it is best to indicate this in the paper itself (e.g., a TODO comment that the reader will see or a hand-written annotation on a hardcopy) rather than verbally or in email that can get forgotten or separated from the paper.</p>

<p>It is most effective to get feedback sequentially rather than in parallel. Rather than asking 3 people to read the same version of your paper, ask one person to read the paper, then make corrections before asking the next person to read it, and so on. This prevents you from getting the same comments repeatedly — subsequent readers can give you new feedback rather than repeating what you already knew, and you&rsquo;ll get feedback on something that is closer to the final version. If you ask multiple reviewers at once, you are de-valuing their time — you are indicating that you don&rsquo;t mind if they waste their time saying something you already know. You might ask multiple reviewers if you are not confident of their judgment or if you are very confident the paper already is in good shape, in which case there are unlikely to be major issues that every reviewer stumbles over.</p>

<p>It usually best not to email the document, but to provide a location from which reviewers can obtain the latest version of the paper, such as a version control repository or a URL you will update. That way, you won&rsquo;t clutter inboxes with many revisions, and readers can always get the most recent copy.</p>

<p>Be generous with your time when colleagues need comments on their papers: you will help them, you will learn what to emulate or avoid, and they will be more willing to review your writing.</p>

<p>Some of your best feedback will be from yourself, especially as you get more thoughtful and introspective about your writing. To take advantage of this, start writing early. One good way to do this is to write a periodic progress report that describes your successes and failures. The progress report will give you practice writing about your work, oftentimes trying out new explanations.</p>

<p>Whereas you should start writing as early as possible, you don&rsquo;t need to put that writing in the form of a technical paper right away. In fact, it&rsquo;s usually best to outline the technical paper, and get feedback on that, before you start to fill in the sections with text. (You might think that you can copy existing text into the paper, but it usually works out better to write the information anew. With your knowledge of the overall structure, goals, and audience, you will be able to do a much better job.) When outlining, I like to start with one sentence about the paper; then write one sentence for each section of the paper; then write one sentence for each subsection; then write one sentence for each paragraph (think of this as the topic sentence); and at that point, it&rsquo;s remarkably easy just to flesh out the paragraphs.</p>

<h3>Responding to conference reviews</h3>

<p>(This section is most relevant to fields like computer science where conferences are the premier publication venue. Responding to journal reviews is different.)</p>

<p>Many conferences provide an author response period: the authors are shown the reviews and are given limited space (say, 500 words) to respond to the reviews, such as by clarifying misunderstandings or answering questions. The author response is sometimes called a “rebuttal”, but I don&rsquo;t like that term because it sets an adversarial tone.</p>

<p>Your paper will only be accepted if there is a champion for the paper: someone who is excited about it and will try to convince the rest of the committee to accept the paper. Your response needs to give ammunition to your champion to overcome objections. If there isn&rsquo;t a champion, then the main goal of your response is to create that champion.</p>

<p>Read the reviews and decide what points you will respond to. You need to focus on the most important and substantive ones.</p>

<p>In your responses, admit your errors forthrightly. Don&rsquo;t ignore or avoid key issues, especially ones that multiple reviewers brought up.</p>

<p>Your response to each point will be one paragraph in your response. Start the paragraph with a brief heading or title about the point. Do not assume that the reviewers remember everything that was written by every reviewer, nor that they will re-read their reviews before reading your response. A little context will help them determine what you are talking about and will make the review stand on its own. This also lets you frame the issues in your own words, which may be clearer or address a more relevant point than the reviews did.</p>

<p>Organize your responses thematically. Group the paragraphs into sections, and have a small heading/title for each section. If a given section has just one paragraph, then you can use the paragraph heading as the section heading. Order the sections from most to least important.</p>

<p>This is better than organizing your response by reviewer, first addressing the comments of reviewer 1, then reviewer 2, and so forth. Downsides of by-reviewer organization include:</p>

<p>It can encourage you not to give sufficient context.
It does not encourage putting related information together nor important information first.
You want to encourage all reviewers to read the entire response, rather than encouraging them to just look at one part.
When multiple reviewers raised the same issue, then no matter where you address it, it&rsquo;s possible for a reviewer to overlook it and think you failed to address it.
You don&rsquo;t want to make glaringly obvious which issues in a review you had to ignore (for reasons of space or other reasons).
You don&rsquo;t want to make glaringly obvious that you spent much more time and space on one reviewer than another.
In general, it&rsquo;s best not to mention reviewer names/numbers in your response at all. Make the response be about the science, not about the people.</p>

<p>Finally, be civil and thankful the reviewers. They have spent considerable time and energy to give you feedback (even if it doesn&rsquo;t seem to you that they have!), and you should be grateful and courteous in return.</p>

<h3>Rejection</h3>

<p>If you submit technical papers, you will experience rejection. In some cases, rejection indicates that you should move on and begin a different line of research. In most cases, the reviews offer an opportunity to improve the work, and so you should be very grateful for a rejection! It is much better for your career if a good paper appears at a later date, rather than than a poor paper earlier or a sequence of weak papers.</p>

<p>Even small flaws or omissions in an otherwise good paper may lead to rejection. This is particularly at the elite venues with small acceptance rates, where you should aim your work. Referees are generally people of good will, but different referees at a conference may have different standards, so the luck of the draw in referees is a factor in acceptance.</p>

<p>The wrong lesson to learn from rejection is discouragement or a sense of personal failure. Many papers — even papers that later win awards — are rejected at least once. The feedback you receive, and the opportunity to return to your work, will invariably improve your results.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be put off by a negative tone in the reviews. The referees are trying to help you, and the bast way to do that is to point out how your work can be improved. I often write a much longer review, with more suggestions for improvement, for papers that I like; if the paper is terrible, I may not be able to make as many concrete suggestions, or my high-level comments may make detailed comments moot.</p>

<p>If a reviewer didn&rsquo;t understand something, then the main fault almost always lies with your writing. If you blame a lazy or dumb reviewer, you are missing the opportunity to improve. Reviewers are not perfect, but they work hard to give you helpful suggestions, so you should give them the benefit of the doubt. Remember that just as it is hard to convey technical ideas in your paper (and if you are getting a rejection, that is evidence that you did not succeed!), it is hard to convey them in a review, and the review is written in a few hours rather than the weeks you spent on the paper (not to mention months or years of understanding the concepts). You should closely attend to both the explicit comments, and to underlying issues that may have led to those comments — it isn&rsquo;t always easy to capture every possible comment in a coherent manner. Think about how to improve your research and your writing, even beyond the explicit suggestions in the review — the prime responsibility for your research and writing belongs with you.</p>

<p>Should you submit an imperfect paper? On the plus side, getting feedback on your paper will help you to improve it. On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t want to waste reviewers&#8217; time nor to get a reputation for submitting half-baked work. If you know the flaws that will make the referees reject your paper, or the valid criticisms that they will raise, then don&rsquo;t submit the paper. Only submit if you aren&rsquo;t aware of show-stoppers and you are not embarrassed for the community to associate your name with the work, in its current form.</p>

<h3>Norman Ramsey&rsquo;s advice</h3>

<p>Norman Ramsey&rsquo;s nice <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/pubs/two-abstract.html">Teach Technical Writing in Two Hours per Week</a> espouses a similar approach to mine: by focusing on clarity in your writing, you will inevitably gain clarity in your thinking.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bother to read both the student and instructor manuals — the student one is a subset of the instructor one. You can get much of the benefit from just one part, his excellent “principles and practices of successful writers”:</p>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<p>Correctness. Write correct English, but know that you have more latitude than your high-school English teachers may have given you.
Consistent names. Refer to each significant character (algorithm, concept, language) using the same word everywhere. Give a significant new character a proper name.
Singular. To distinguish one-to-one relationships from n-to-m relationships, refer to each item in the singular, not the plural.
Subjects and verbs. Put your important characters in subjects, and join each subject to a verb that expresses a significant action.
Information flow. In each sentence, move your reader from familiar information to new information.
Emphasis. For material you want to carry weight or be remembered, use the end of a sentence.
Coherence. In a coherent passage, choose subjects that refer to a consistent set of related concepts.
Parallel structure. Order your text so your reader can easily see how related concepts are different and how they are similar.
Abstract. In an abstract, don&rsquo;t enumerate a list of topics covered; instead, convey the essential information found in your paper.
Practices</p>

<p>Write in brief daily sessions. Ignore the common myth that successful writing requires large, uninterrupted blocks of time — instead, practice writing in brief, daily sessions.
Focus on the process, not the product. Don&rsquo;t worry about the size or quality of your output; instead, reward yourself for the consistency and regularity of your input.
Prewrite. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to think before you write, or even jot down notes, diagrams, and so on.
Use index cards. Use them to plan a draft or to organize or reorganize a large unit like a section or chapter.
Write a Shitty First Draft™. Value a first draft not because it&rsquo;s great but because it&rsquo;s there.
Don&rsquo;t worry about page limits. Write the paper you want, then cut it down to size.
Cut. Plan a revision session in which your only goal is to cut.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>这些年自己在科研工作中有过困惑和领悟，因此我想利用这个blog把它们写下来。这些问题其实没有标准答案、对错等等，仅仅是一些想法。</p>

<p>我最近参加conference的时候，知道有些同行和学生看过我的这些posts。如果你有什么有趣的问题、评论等，欢迎利用这个blog交流。</p>

<h3>part1</h3>

<p>Q: 我导师让我看的东西没有什么理论。我喜欢有beauty的事情。我觉得研究也应该有beauty，可是我每天看见的都是杂乱无章的东西，实在没意思。怎么办？</p>

<p> A:  我也喜欢有beauty的东西，包括研究。可是我真正喜欢做的恰恰是把今天看来ugly的东西变成beautiful的东西。这是我认为的scientific contribution. 如果你每天摆弄的已经是beautiful的东西，能有什么contribution呢？比如，LR文法很漂亮地解决了programming language的parsing，还有多少有眼光的学者愿意再研究此问题呢？</p>

<!--more-->


<p>门捷列夫元素周期表给后人看多漂亮。可我相信门捷列夫首先看见的是杂乱无章的东西。是他给了我们beauty。漂亮的研究工作就是你能把沙子吞进去，再在把金子吐出来.</p>

<p> Q : 我导师让我找课题。我发现其实到了今天，在system security领域，该做的idea都已经被别人做了。你觉得呢？(Credit: 这个Q&amp;A受到我的实习生王锐与我交谈的启发)</p>

<p>A:  不止一个学生向我谈到这个“发现”。对这个“发现”可以有两种理解。一、system security领域好的课题真的很少了；二、你想到的每个好课题都被别人做过了。有科研经历的人都知道找题一直都是非常难的。要想证明第一种观点，你显然要说明为什么今天（2010年春天）比以往更难找system security topic。是学术界或工业界发生了什么大变化吗？似乎没有。看看2010年的Oakland论文集，论文质量比以往显著下降了吗？似乎也没有。也可能真的在很多年以后回顾system security research的历史，发现2010年春天是个“断层”— 在此之前还算欣欣向荣，在此之后突然终止。但是我会忽略这个可能性。</p>

<p>我觉得更可能的情况是你自己在2010年春天没有找到好的课题，因此有了这个不爽的“发现”。那怎么办呢？我有些建议：一、充分认识到找题就是一件很难的事，要有足够的耐心；二、是不是你的focus太小了？你也许只是在一个specific sub-domain中找。应该拓宽自己的background；三、你找题是不是天天盯着论文集，看看别人缺那块你给补上？这样很难找好的题目。艺术家经常强调深入生活。找题也有些类似 – 应该是来源于对现实事物的观察，向别人展示你独特的视角。如果你能发现一件人们经常看经常用的东西蕴藏着一些一般人没有想到的巧妙之处，别人当然会很欣赏你的科研能力。</p>

<p> Q: 科研在很多时候也就是搞笑。有多少时候科研成果真正有用？无非自娱自乐而已。</p>

<p>A:  我有时有同感，但没有你这么绝对。要知道科研是一种投资，包括积累知识、培养人才。这种投资就象买彩票。买的时候你不知道哪张会中大奖。如果没有科研活动，我觉的人类还会象工业革命之前那么落后，所以可以肯定的是科研活动总体上是推动社会的，而不是纯粹自娱自乐。这好比花了很多钱买彩票，兑奖后发现总体还是赚了的。当然，我们总还是希望少买些中不了的彩票，但这是个research management的问题，是具体的评价奖惩措施的问题，并不会上升到科研对社会的意义这个高度。</p>

<p>其实更重要的一点是：你知道有些人的科研不是搞笑的。如果你有自由选择搞笑或不搞笑，你会选择什么？当然，如果你所在的环境不允许你选择“不搞笑”，那就另当别论了。</p>

<p> Q: 你们微软研究院的研究似乎着眼于非常实际的问题。我们在大学里可能更兴趣有理论意义的问题。这是否是公司与大学的不同目标造成的差别？(Credit: 这个Q&amp;A来自于与一位清华在校博士生的交谈)</p>

<p>A:  我不认为公司研究院“应该”做什么样的研究和大学“应该”做什么样的研究有区别。只要是一流的研究，大家都“应该”做。微软研究院有理论天才，包括Fields Medal winner. 考虑一个课题该不该做，出发点不是说它是理论的还是实际的，而是它是不是top的。</p>

<p>我个人的观点是在system security领域，绝大多数top research是来自实际问题。可能会有理论成分，但最终又回归到实际中去。我总觉得模型、公式、定理都只是一种交流的语言。真正有价值的是观察，思考与实践。另外，美国的顶尖大学的课题似乎也相当结合实际的。</p>

<p> Q: 微软研究院的研究员似乎不太相信数学的力量，似乎不相信理论指导实践这种说法。比如，我提出在搭建实际系统前要建理论模型，进行simulation。他们说没必要，直接搭建实际系统再说。(Credit: 这个Q&amp;A来自于与一位实习生的交谈)</p>

<p>A:  我对你的领域不很了解。如果问我对“理论指导实践”这种说法是否赞同，我觉得因情况而异。到底理论在多大程度上能说明实际？有个很有意思的说法(credit: Emre Kiciman):“理论上说，理论应该吻合于实际；但实际上，它们往往不吻合。”在多大程度上靠理论来指导，似乎是一个经验判断。恰巧你说的这两位不相信理论模型的研究员是圈子里的大牛和中牛，而且这位中牛在博士生期间最有影响的成果之一就是对系统的建模，因此我猜他不算“不太相信数学的力量”的人。我觉得做system research, 没有理论指导也不是什么shame, 倒是practical irrelevance比较要命。</p>

<h3>part2</h3>

<p>Q: 做好的科研项目需要信心。信心从哪里来？</p>

<p>A: 如果决定选个很好的题目做，信心真的非常重要。不过我觉得真正的信心只有一个来源–自信心。我曾经希望能从导师或其他资深的人那里得到肯定，从而获得信心。现在领悟到这样的信心不会很有意义。你为什么觉得有某个idea非常有希望？大多是因为你有一个直觉，认为其他人没有这样想过。多数情况下你没法用语言表达这个直觉。既然没法表达，别人就很难获得你的直觉。假设我的研究主任现在告诉我这个idea肯定能做出来，那就有两种情况：(i) 如果他能具体列出一二三四条原因证明为什么这个idea一定能做出来，我应该会相当失望，而且不再愿意做这个idea了。你想，我原先很为之激动的idea, 居然三言两语就可以说清楚为什么一定能做出来，那我真正把它做出来又能说明什么？(ii) 如果他不能具体证明这个idea一定能做出来，那么很大程度上他说的仅仅是“我相信你一定做得出来。”实际上这个问题还是推给了我：我自己相信我做得出来吗？</p>

<p>Q: 怎么看待博士学位？</p>

<p>A: 获得博士学位可以算是人生履历的一个挺重要的元素。不说别的，光是花费的时间就够significant，一般是5到6年。我回忆自己获得博士学位的那些年，觉得有很多美好的感觉，自己在科研上确实上了一个层次。这个经历应该会影响我的一生。</p>

<p>不过，获得过博士学位其实和当年当过兵、插过队类似，别把学位本身太当回事。以下分情况讨论几种case:</p>

<p>(1) 博士把博士学位太当回事。我曾经在与几位在大学任教（当然都是博士）的朋友聊天。我们都是研究security的。我们谈到了软件中为什么总是有security bug。不止一位朋友说，“绝大多数programmer水平不高。他们几乎都是学士和硕士。”我不同意这种说法。programming skill与是否有博士学位没有什么关系。（如果非要说关系，我甚至更相信有“反比”关系 — 我相信有一部分博士连Tower of Hanoi和matrix multiplication之类中学生都会的程序也写不出来。）博士如果对“非博士制造”的东西不屑一顾，是不明智的，因为现实世界绝大多数东西是“非博士制造”。头脑被困在象牙塔里的博士很难找到有现实意义的课题，因为他们会觉得这些问题不高深，无非是些“非博士”们没能力在“博士”们的高度看清问题的本质。我觉得想做好的研究，肯定要走出象牙塔，看看复杂、无序和带有各种限制条件的“非博士制造”的现实世界，这才是看清问题的本质。别把博士帽当成孙悟空的头箍来戴。</p>

<p>(2) 准博士把博士学位太当回事。我在做低年级博士生的时候觉得博士学位很值钱。后来，当我在邮箱中拿到博士证书的时候，我感觉到那就是一件除了我家人以外没有人有兴趣看的纪念品。让我真正为之奋斗多年的不是学位，而是对于从事科研工作的能力和勇气的积累。</p>

<p>(3) 非博士把博士学位太当回事。说白了，博士学位仅仅证明了一个人在一个或几个教授指导下做了几年研究，而且合格了。不要对博士学位有更多的解读，比如“很博学”，“很聪明”，“理论造诣很高”，甚至“他/她是计算机博士，你的电脑坏了他/她一定知道怎么修”，等等。</p>

<p>Q: 你导师给你的最有意义的指导是什么？</p>

<p>A: 我的导师在fault tolerance圈子很有名。他是ACM和IEEE的会士。这样的大教授通常很难指望他在具体项目上有什么真正insightful的指导，但是回想那些年，我觉得有两点深刻影响了我的研究。我很感激和佩服他。</p>

<p>第一，很多博士生想夏天去公司实习，他们的导师们不太乐意。理由是“影响科研进度”，“学不到东西”之类。如果导师开恩，一个学生在整个博士生期间也许可以做一两次实习。我的导师恰恰相反。他相信实习非常有益。每年春天，他都给学生们推荐实习机会。最极端的是，每年都有一次全组的会，会上每个人报告夏天将要去哪里实习。说“我不想去实习”的学生要说明为什么，然后他再严肃地教育一番。结果我博士生期间每个夏天都做实习。接触不同的人、做不同的项目，收获很多。尤其是体会到做系统研究应该着手实际问题。这方面公司的研究院有比较明显的优势。</p>

<p>第二，他特别强调要多“看”。他给一个学生an exciting project，往往不是因为他有了什么巧妙的想法，而是因为他找到了（或弄到了）一堆关于实际系统的数据，他很想分析。他曾经让我看securityfocus.com上的bug reports（当时有6500多个），做综合的分析。他觉得这个课题很有意义，我当时觉得太没劲了。我曾问他“我们有什么具体思路呢？有了好的思路后看这些reports才有目的性。”他说“我们还没有什么好的思路，所以我们才要努力地看。我的经验是看得多了就会有思路。”我当时挺不以为然：这叫什么指导？不过我还是坚持下来。渐渐地，我看得越来越快，而且有时一个新的report可以联想到几个旧的，它们不再是完全杂乱无章的。回想这个阶段，我觉得它给我后来的课题打下了基础。我现在相信了“看得多了就会有思路”的说法。
做系统研究，看、想、做和辩都是需要的。为什么我导师特别强调“看”呢？也许是因为不少学生经常忽视它，而陷入到胡想、傻做和穷辩的境地。当你头脑里没有一定数量的活生生的例子，你有什么可想的呢？就算有了一个想法，但你的知识捉襟见肘，你怎么知道它好不好？这种时候，千万别开始做，应该接着看。还有一点，“看”对“辩”很有好处。我在开题答辩时有个教授说，“你提出的方法不太行啊。如果情况是这样这样加上那样那样，你的方法是无效的。”他说的是对的。幸好我对所涉及到的例子比较熟。我很肯定地告诉他，“您说的是对的。不过我看过了大约20个此类例子，没有一个有您说的‘这样这样加上那样那样’的情况。”我觉得他对我的回答是认可的。很多时候，答辩并不是看你想得是否complete，而是你能不能论证它的significance，毕竟我们不是做理论研究的。教授们不太熟悉你的研究领域，因此更可能天马行空地发问。你若没有倚仗自己看的实际东西比他们多，而被他们揪住一起论道，那就有些囧了。</p>

<h3>part3</h3>

<p>Q: 为什么你建议选题要从实际出发？难道选题不该从内心的兴趣出发吗？</p>

<p>A: 选题当然该从内心的兴趣出发。这点毫无疑问。既然要把兴趣这个词掺合进来，那我的本意就是“建议你培养自己对实际问题的兴趣，这才能找到好的题目。”不过我觉得科研其实是非常personal的一件事。每个人都有各自的原因而兴趣一种特定类型的课题：有人很兴趣高深莫测的东西，也许因为世界上只有很少人懂，而他是其中一个。也有人很兴趣探索艰深甚至无解的难题，而享受每一个progress带来的乐趣。我个人的兴趣是找于现实有密切关系的题。是否高深是否难解都不是影响我兴趣的因素。</p>

<p>当然，还有很大一部分人是为了“灌水”而弄出些高深难解的题目来做，而完全不考虑做出来的东西有没有用。我印象很深的是周星驰的《国产凌凌漆》中的一些“发明”，比如一位安全部研究所的研究员发明的太阳能手电筒(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM3khoMrp-g%EF%BC%8C1%E2%80%9930%E2%80%9D">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM3khoMrp-g%EF%BC%8C1%E2%80%9930%E2%80%9D</a>), 以及周星驰一系列“情报员装备”— 手机型的剃须刀，剃须刀型的吹风机，等等 (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPmTuOU0QoY&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPmTuOU0QoY&amp;feature=related</a>)。这些发明不可谓不novel，技术不可谓不先进，但关键是这些东西有什么用呢？唯一的justification就是周星驰说的“作为情报员，外表很重要。”显然太扯了。我有时在读论文(包括在审论文)时有非常类似的感觉。读完introduction的时候，心里说“Wow! Are you serious? You spent so much effort to build this useless stuff?”</p>

<p>Q: 导师说我写的东西不合格，可是英文又不是我的母语，我觉得有些无奈。怎么办？</p>

<p>A: 在我写博士期间第一篇第一作者论文时，我挺认真地写了第一稿。我的导师说我写得很差。我觉得有些委屈。我说我刚来美国不久，英文写作当然不好。导师说的一句话我后来想起来觉得很精辟。他说，“我说你写作不好，不是你英文写作不好。写论文要的是persuasive writing，主要是看你的论据的架构和逻辑性，每句话里使用的词汇和表达方式是否地道倒是次要的。我虽然不懂中文，但你的这篇英文稿，我相信你用中文也写不好。” 后来高年级和工作之后，对导师的观点更有体会。有时也有学生谈到英文写作有困难。我往往会搬出我导师的观点，甚至challenge说，如果你不相信，你就干脆用中文写，看看是不是好文章。如果是，你就完成任务了，翻译任务由我负责。我想如果作为一个导师，只要做翻译工作就可以发很好的论文，应该会偷着乐吧。</p>

<h3>part4</h3>

<p>Q: 开题是个怎样的过程？</p>

<p>A: 开题对做研究的人来说绝对重要。有些学生对于它究竟是个怎样的过程不见得清楚。我想开题就是为自己的项目定一个蓝图。一个好的项目应该是深度、广度和可行性的结合，而这个蓝图就是在开始具体工作前仔细地思考清楚我要论证什么、论证它有什么意义、什么论据才能论证它（也顺便思考一下为什么我比别人有什么优势更可能做到）。这些问题需要具体的答案，而不能马马虎虎想当然。</p>

<p>有的学生把开题和定方向混淆起来。导师更多时候只是给你一个方向。他（她）今天建议你去研究social network privacy，明天建议张三去研究cloud computing security,后天再让李四去研究new threat on mobile OS。不要以为这就算开题了 - 开题是个费脑筋的探索过程。</p>

<p>Q: 我的不少想法导师说太宽。难道课题的breadth不好吗？</p>

<p>A: 一个开好的题应该能够从“上层”贯穿到“下层”。“上层”就是这个项目的帽子，即主题；“下层”是这个项目的架子，是比较具体的元素。</p>

<p>也许可以设想一个情景,做个换位思考，来理解导师的意见。假设你的团队思考各种方法赚钱。一个年轻人说：“我想去非洲挖黄金，因为如果挖到了，我们就发了！”你会立刻批准吗？应该不会吧。那“去非洲挖黄金”这个课题还需要什么具体的元素呢？我想我至少会问他如下问题：(1)非洲那么大，从哪里挖起？(2)你是用锄头还是挖掘机去挖？(3)计划挖到地面下几尺？挖一立方尺要多少时间？ (4)课题分几个阶段？每个阶段判断成功的标准是什么？他如果对这些问题的回答非常含糊，那就可能只想了“帽子”没想“架子”。</p>

<p>在这个例子中，导师的concern并不是针对“去非洲挖黄金”这个帽子本身，而是因为它没有具体的元素支撑。我们可以设想另一种情形 &ndash; 这个年轻人回答：“我有可能挖到，因为我相信开罗有一所中学建在某法老的地宫之上[见史料xyz]。我估算它在地下30尺左右。我想从开罗一中操场开始挖。打算雇三个当地人打一口井。如果打到45尺还没有成功，我就转到开罗二中，然后开罗三中，以此类推。”我觉得这样的开题可以算是thoughtful。同样是“去非洲挖黄金”这顶帽子，却让人明白他具体想怎样实施他的计划。虽然他的计划听起来可能有点天方夜谭，但它包含了一套自上而下的思路。</p>

    <id>http://secdr.github.io/2015/05/04/research-is-not-easy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>点评：北京大学王铁磊博士走过的是一条开始研究的理想道路，他认为好的开始是成功的一半，阅读大量论文和实现别人论文工作的原型，慢慢积累了研究的感觉，突破了早期的困惑。王铁磊博士虽然是跨专业读博士，通过阅读、实验和不懈挖掘，最终却实现了高水平会议论文的突破。从他的研究方向出发，他推荐学好算法、体系结构和信息安全课程。</p>

<p>问：您认为自己能获得CCF优博的主要原因是什么？
王铁磊：在如此激烈的竞争中出围，首先非常感谢评审专家们对我的研究工作的肯定和认可。我的研究领域是系统安全，主要关注软件安全漏洞挖掘。在系统安全领域，IEEE Security &amp; Privacy、ACM CCS、USENIX Security和ISOC NDSS这四个会议享有崇高的声誉，是公认的顶级学术会议。尤其是IEEE Security &amp; Privacy，是整个信息安全界历史最悠久的学术会议之一，自1980年举办以来一直引领国际安全研究的潮流；信息安全领域很多里程碑式的工作最初都在该会议上发表。这四个顶级学术会议长期被欧美等国研究人员垄断，大陆研究人员鲜有声音。2009年，我在NDSS会议上发表了关于整数溢出漏洞检测的论文，是自NDSS创立16年来中国大陆研究机构首次以第一作者单位在NDSS会议上发表的论文。2010年，我的关于校验和感知的模糊测试技术的科研论文，历经5轮严格评审，成功在IEEESecurity &amp; Privacy会议上发表，并赢得最佳学生论文奖。这是IEEE Security &amp; Privacy 自1980年举办以来，大陆科研机构首次在该会议上发表论文。2012年，我科研论文在信息安全顶级期刊ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC)发表,也是中国大陆科研机构在TISSEC发表的首篇论文。总结而言，这些研究工作实现了中国大陆在TISSEC、IEEE S&amp;P、NDSS等信息安全领域顶级学术期刊/会议上以第一作者发表论文的突破。这也是我能赢得CCF优博论文的重要原因。</p>

<h3>关于博士研究</h3>

<p>问：请以科普的语言描述一下您的博士论文想解决的问题？
王铁磊：软件安全漏洞已成为网络空间安全博弈的重要资源。如何准确的发现漏洞、有效的 消除或减少漏洞对社会生活、国家信息安全的负面影响，是信息安全领域的研究热点。我的博士论文以面向二进制程序漏洞挖掘为总体目标，重点研究在没有源代码的情况下，如何自动发现软件产品中漏洞。论文中设计实现的软件安全漏洞挖掘系统已经在Microsoft、Adobe、Google等著名IT公司的产品中发现数十个零日（0-day，未公开的）漏洞，大部分漏洞已被国家安全漏洞库、国际安全漏洞机构CVE等权威漏洞管理组织收录。</p>

<p>问：您认为自己博士期间最满意的研究工作是什么？创新何在？
王铁磊：我博士期间的主要研究方向是软件安全漏洞挖掘。我最喜欢的工作是，我在国际上首次提出了一种在模糊测试（Fuzzing）中穿透校验和（Checksum）检查的方法。校验和机制是常用的数据完整性检测方法，有效阻止畸形数据向程序纵深传递，是动态漏洞挖掘中的一个公认难题。我提出的校验和感知模糊测试方法成功绕过程序中的校验和检查机制，不依赖于程序源代码及具体的校验和算法，自动化程度高，为运用模糊测试发现深藏的软件漏洞扫除了障碍，大大拓宽了传统模糊测试方法的应用范围。 相关研究论文发表于信息安全领域国际顶级学术会议IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2010，并荣获最佳学生论文奖。</p>

<p>问：博士期间自己遇到的最大困难是什么？如何克服了这些困难？
王铁磊：一个好的开始是成功的一半，因此取得&#8221;好的开始&#8221;是非常困难的。对我而言，第一个研究项目、第一篇论文都是最难的。我读博早期很长一段时间内，一直困惑于自己能做什么。一方面，感觉其他团队的技术实现都非常出色，自己找不到创新点；另一方面，感觉自己要解决的问题太复杂、太困难，找不到一个完美的解决方法。为了克服这些困难，我阅读了大量论文，从中理出每个团队技术发展的轨迹，同时也总结每个团队所研究的问题的变迁。为了更好的理解其他团队的技术，我还根据其论文的描述，尝试实现这些原型系统。在自己实现的过程中，能够很好的理解别人方法的优势，同时也能够发现别人方法的不足。找到别人方法的不足进而尝试改进、完善，是我在博士前期研究思路之一。在这个思路指导下，我慢慢积累了一些学术研究的感觉，掌握了现有技术的发展水平，同时也找到了一些研究点，我的研究状态走上了正轨。</p>

<h3>关于论文发表</h3>

<p>问：在博士课题研究中，您觉得最重要或印象最深刻的是什么？
王铁磊：学术竞争非常激烈。全世界那么多优秀的研究人员都在同一个研究方向努力时，可能经常出现这个现象：不同研究团队对同一个问题提出了非常类似的解决方法。但是学术研究有着很强的时效性，这意味着一个团队的论文发表后，留给其他团队的空间就非常小了。2009-2010年间，我的一项研究取得了非常好的结果。但是，在撰写论文的过程中，我突然发现MIT的一个研究人员也在做类似的事情，而且他的论文刚刚被一个顶级会议录用。这使我非常沮丧。我的导师邹维老师给了我很多鼓励和支持。首先，他肯定了我的工作。他认为类似的工作发表在顶级会议上，说明我的研究也是具有这个实力的。这给了我很大的信心。其次，他鼓励我进一步挖掘这个方向的潜力，不要因为别人工作发表了，就放弃了自己的工作。在邹老师的鼓励下，我继续围绕当时那项工作解决不了的问题展开研究并获得了突破。最终论文发表在了信息安全领域的顶级会议IEEE Security &amp; Privacy 2010上。</p>

<p>问：您在博士期间发表了多篇高水平论文，有什么经验体会？
王铁磊：经验谈不上，我也还在不断学习和改进的过程中。从研究角度讲，我个人觉得，“好论文”的准则之一是用创新的方法解决了一个重要的问题。广泛调研、深入学习是发现问题、找到创新方法的关键。从写作角度讲，多读能够发现别人论文之美， 多写能提高自己写作不足。此外，每篇论文都真正的用心写作，注意每个细节。很多时候，审稿人可以感觉出作者的认真态度。</p>

<h3>关于课程</h3>

<p>问：课程学习在您的研究过程中起到了多大的作用？就您的研究所了解，你觉得哪些课程最重要？如果感觉作用很大，请具体讲讲。如果感觉作用不是很大，课程教学中还有些什么问题，能否给出一些建议？
王铁磊：我本科专业是物理学，虽然选修或旁听了一些计算机系的课程，自己总是觉得知识不够。因此，从博士阶段的课程中，我受益良多。就我个人而言，算法、体系结构和信息安全三门课程最重要。体系结构让我对整个计算机体系有了很好的理解和认识；信息安全课程让我学会的大量的专业基础知识；算法课程提高了我编程能力。这些经典课程并不会直接影响我的研究内容，但是带给我的影响是巨大的。</p>

<h3>寄语</h3>

<p>问：今后有什么打算？对在读的学生有何寄语？
王铁磊：争取在学术研究的道路上取得更大的进步，推动自己研究成果的实际应用。读博是个漫长过程，有生活压力，有研究压力。希望各位博士同学，多一分耐心，多一分坚持，多一分快乐。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>号外，号外，德国Springer和《自然》集团合并啦！俺兴（Bu）奋（Xie）地围观一下，其实心里想的是管我屁事，又不会——“特大喜讯，为了庆祝两集团合并，杂志大开放，来稿就刊出”，其次Springer是啥，头一次注意，都不好意思说自己不知道，只能跟着瞎起哄！希望各位小伙伴看完这篇文章后，对四大杂志社巨头有所了解，提升一点逼格！
——李莫愁博士</p>

<p>四大杂志社巨头分别是东毒、西邪、南丐、北帝，哈哈，我开玩笑的啦！咳咳，我正经一点，分别是——Springer，ELSEVIER, WILEY和Taylor&amp;Francis Group。很陌生吧？那么看了下面的LOGO，那马头，那棵树熟悉不？后面两个（一个咒语和一掌阿拉神灯）就看着眼生了。</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img src="http://secdr.github.io/upload/fourpress.png" alt="four press" /></p>

<p>这几家杂志社，有三个共性——大龄、任性、有钱！</p>

<h3>关于大龄：</h3>

<p>先讲新婚不久的Springer，1841年生，170多岁了，你很莫然地看着我，好吧，我们换个说法，慈禧那会的事情，Springer诞生的时候，慈禧还没有死老公，不对，确切说还在穿开裆裤。也就是说Springer和慈禧是看着同样的动画片《喜羊羊》长大的！</p>

<p><img src="http://secdr.github.io/upload/pressdev.png" alt="pressdev" /></p>

<p>WILEY笑了，1807年生，当时嘉庆皇帝正在兴致勃勃地抄和珅家，他万万没有想到国外的一个叫WILEY的杂志社诞生了，不然他肯定从和珅家拿点当贺礼送过去。嘉庆是谁？（历史学的不好吧？）嘉庆大老婆生了道光，道光是咸丰他爹，而慈禧是咸丰的老婆，所以算下来,WILEY:“Springer小朋友，快来认老祖宗！”</p>

<p>Taylor&amp;Francis Group 哈哈大笑，跟我比老，老子1798年生，Taylor创办后一年，乾隆就死了，乾隆一死，嘉庆一边披麻戴孝一边偷着乐，一直垂涎和珅家的金银财宝，这回发大财。Taylor：“WILEY，快叫爹！”</p>

<p>ELSEVIER：“你们玩，我先走了！”（1880年生）</p>

<h3>关于任性：</h3>

<p>ELSEVIER：“我旗下有3075本杂志”</p>

<p>Springer:”我也不赖，旗下有2987本杂志”</p>

<p>Wiley:”我马马虎虎，旗下2339本杂志”</p>

<p>Taylor:”你们玩，我先走了！”（2105本杂志）</p>

<p>Springer早就看ELESVIER不顺眼，可惜又没有人家会下蛋，娶一个会下蛋的社交名媛——《自然》（旗下160本杂志），于是就出现了开篇说的“大事”，Springer以微弱的优势完胜ELESVIER。ELESVIER：“你，你，我，我…..我也去娶一个，我娶…..我娶中华医学会！”（我瞎掰的啦，咋么可能？！）</p>

<h3>关于有钱：</h3>

<p>其实最刚开始，这几个货都是穷屌丝……这是几个屌丝逆袭迎娶白富美的故事。</p>

<p>先讲Wiley逆袭的故事：Charles Wiley老人家最开始开办了一家小小的印刷厂，需要申明的是，这不是国企，所以，Charles Wiley干得格外卖命（不然就会破产倒闭喝西北风），他将出版社取名为Wiley，足以证明他有多自恋，后来他做着做着就，你想说发财是吧，其实我想说的是做着做着就死了……他的儿子John Wiley接着做，做着做着也死了，他的儿子XX Wiley又接着做，又死了……更多的XXX Wiley前赴后继地投入到Wiley杂志社，最后都死了。Wiley杂志社是家族企业，至于这些Wiley在漫长岁月中经历的一长串的商业并购案，大家有兴趣可以自己查阅，但是1962年他向员工发行了股票，结束了私有制，迈向了现代化的企业模式。</p>

<p>至于这个跟女巫符咒一样的logo，是Charles Wiley的儿子JohnWiley干的，原本他老子设计的logo是“WC”，但是JohnWiley等他老爹一死，一是他也很自恋，二是觉得WC搞得跟厕所似的，就给改成了“WJ”，自己的名字缩写。（呵呵，这段是我编的，我猜是这么回事）</p>

<p>我们再来讲讲ELSEVIER，这个名字大家有点陌生，但是提到《柳叶刀》、《cell》,明白了吧，这两本牛掰的杂志都是他家的，所以ELSEVIER是相当牛掰的。每年共有250,000篇论文发表在ELSEVIER公司出版的期刊中（25万篇哦，庞大的数字，可惜你一篇都没有投中）。</p>

<p>论文界有一件很奇葩的事情，就是我花钱做实验，我发表文章还要交钱，最后我下载文献时还得花钱购买数据库，为什么受伤的总是我？由此可见科学家都是受虐狂。</p>

<p>其实这事对于中国人，那都不叫事，只要能发，其他好商量！但是牛哄哄的外国人就不这样想这件事情，他们认为2000-2010年间，爱思唯尔的利润率从来没有低于过30%（搞得更中国国企似的），举个例子“北京大学图书馆2010年购买爱思唯尔科技期刊电子数据库的费用为61万美元。”那么单从北京大学图书馆，爱思唯尔就纯获利100多万人民币，如果全球有1000家图书馆订阅，那么利润是10亿元人民币，当然我想数字远不止10亿。你知道这货有多土豪了吧！</p>

<p>于是大家就想着打土豪分田地，2012年有个大名鼎鼎的数学家威廉·提摩西·高尔斯（其实我不认识），号召同行行动起来，抵制世界上最大的出版商爱思唯尔集团，他们建立了一个网站，命名为“知识的代价”（The Cost of Knowledge），有大约1.4万多名科学家在网站上签了名，他们发誓，不在爱思唯尔旗下的期刊发表论文，不做审稿人，或者不担任编辑。他们认为“我们投稿、审稿都是义务的。研究成果都是国家纳税人的钱，为什么到后来我们的研究成果成为他们的摇钱树了呢？”</p>

<p>注意“摇钱树”三个字，不得不佩服Elzevir家族的先见之明，看看Elzevir的LOGO，一个老人站在树下，仿佛要伸手去摇这棵树——摇钱树（嘿嘿，这段也是我瞎掰的，实际上还没有人知道这个logo的真正含义，也许创始人想说的是：别猜了，我也就是随手找的一个logo）</p>

<p>再讲讲Springer，他是世界上最大的私营科技出版社，注意了这两个字——私营，故事要从150年说起，出版社的创始人叫尤利乌斯·施普林格（Julius Springer），25岁时在柏林开设了一家书店，并同时开始其科学图书的出版工作。（注意Spinger又是个人名，如果这事放在中国，就好比武大郎给自己的烧饼取名武大郎烧饼，陈小二开家超市就叫陈小二小卖部。）</p>

<p>尤利乌斯·施普林格是一位国际象棋的爱好者，他出版了一系列这个方面的图书，又因为“施普林格”（Springer）这个词在德文中意即“象棋中的马”。这个商标意义重大，因为还有一家公司叫阿克塞尔·斯普林格（Axel Springer）出版集团，当然创始人就叫阿克塞尔·斯普林格（Axel Springer也是相当土豪，只可惜挂得比较早，便宜了他的第五个老婆，轻轻松松成为了亿万富婆，啊哦，讲偏题了）。因为他俩名字长得太像了，所以只能靠商标来区分。</p>

<p>尤利乌斯·施普林格于1877年去世，后面的故事大抵是一样的，家族传承，将这份事业发扬光大，至今未倒闭。施普林格也出版了一些中国著名学者的著作，例如华罗庚的《数论导引》和《从单位圆谈起》、许宝禄的《论文选集》、吴文俊等人的《走向21世纪的中国数学》以及陈省身教授主编的《天津偏微分方程讨论会文集》等等（呵呵，一本都没有读过）。说一本部分医生熟悉的书——陈中伟院士出版的《显微外科》英文版本，就是Springer出版发行的（呵呵，还是没有读过英文版本的）。</p>

<p>终于讲到最后一家了，Taylor &amp; Francis Group（泰勒-弗朗西斯出版集团），从名字上我们可以知道，是两个人合创了这家公司，Richard Taylor和William Francis，故取名泰勒-弗朗西斯。我的脑洞现在有点大，倘诺中国的公司名字也采用这种取名方式的话，是不是可以防止一些跑路的人员，比如满大街的投资公司，一看招牌——黄麻子理财公司，就知道老板叫黄麻子，跑不了了，是不是可以减少经济犯罪？（上面又是我胡想的）。这两位创始人之后的故事大抵是一样的，子乘父业，经历了数次并购，终于发展成为了今天的规模。这家公司有多土豪呢？2007年，T&amp;F的母公司Informa集团的总收入是11.3亿英镑，调整后的利润是2.61亿英镑，折合人民币约23亿，不过比起中国的房地产商，这点钱算是毛毛雨吧！</p>

<p>终于把这四大杂志社都蜻蜓点水般地带过了，也许大家吹牛皮侃大山时能用上吧！如有错误，请大家多多指正！</p>
