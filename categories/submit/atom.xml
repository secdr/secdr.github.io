    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>你在遵循了所有关于论文撰写的建议并将文章投给选择的期刊后，就应该做下面这些事情了：</p>

<p>1，如果该期刊和它的编辑在业内有了一定名气而且比较负责任的话，你将会在两周内收到一封确认函。否则，你应该咨询一下，因为有时确实会发生稿件丢失的情况。</p>

<p>2，确认稿件收到后，你应该耐心地等待评审决定。我个人建议，如果四个月内还没有收到消息的话，你应该给编辑写信，礼貌地询问评审的进展。因为有时有的编辑和评审人确实不负责任。一旦他们答应处理你的论文，他们就应该给予你及时的答复。不过，你一定要有礼貌，表现出应有的专业精神，要记住，论文评审是一种志愿行为。作为作者，一味苛求别人对你自己一点好处也没有。 <!--more--></p>

<p>3，终于，编辑的回复来了。如果编辑接受了你的文章，不需要修改或仅仅要求很小的改动，那么，恭喜了！</p>

<p>4，更为可能的情况是——文章不会被原样照收，编辑会让你大改特改，然后重新接受评审；或者情况更糟——文章被拒了。不论是哪一种情况，你都需要作出决定。现在我根据自己的经验谈谈下一步该怎么做。</p>

<p>5，如果文章直接被拒了，那么你需要考虑这一判决是否正当。大多数时候，期刊拒绝文章都有很充足的理由，包括对你的文章的价值的判断。这个时候作者应该接受这一结果，并从中吸取经验教训。在极少的情况下，如果你认为结果确实不公平，想要提出抗议，那么你的证据务必非常充足，理由非常充分。此外，很多时候如果你权衡一下抗议行为所要付出的代价，你会发现其实惹这些麻烦并不划算。我们几乎每个人一生可能只会做出那么一两个真正重要的发现。没人说世界绝对公平，大多数时候并不值得为这种“小事”生气。</p>

<p>6，大多数评审人都是公平的而且会给出建设性的意见，当你修改文章时应该仔细地考虑这些意见。尽量不要因为某个评审人讽刺挖苦你就生气懊恼，轮到他们自己投稿时，便是他们“还债”的时候了。因此，回应这些评论时别冷嘲热讽，小里小气的。恼怒只会伤害你自己的事业，有句话说得好：“别生气，想办法让论文被接收才叫打了个平手。”</p>

<p>7，当你写回信的时候，附上修改稿和/或者对评审意见的逐条回复，要记住，现在距离他/她上次审阅你的文章和写下评论可能已经过去几个月了。所以，要尽量使他觉得简单轻松。首先，给评审人每人写一封通用的封面信，感谢他们的工作和评论。接下来向他/她保证你已经考虑了每一条意见，并罗列出你的补充工作，逐条答复评审意见。最后逐条复制他们的评论并同时并排给出你的答复，要记住，这个时候大多数评审人可能已经忘记了他们以前是怎么评价你的文章的了。你需要把事情弄得简单些，给他们一些提醒。此外，这样做表示你认真考虑了他们的评论，你的努力和诚恳会给他们留下深刻的印象的。</p>

<p>8，如果你很好地做到了上述的第6条和第7条，那么并不是评审人的所有意见你都必须赞同。不过如果你真的不能同意他们的意见的话，一定要显得专业，不带一点怨气。最重要的是，你要有很好的理由解释清楚为什么你不能按照他的建议去做。公平的评审人和编辑会尊重你的。</p>

<p>9，最重要的是，要记住你的任务是赢得评审人而不是跟“挑战”评审人。评审人和作者之间的战斗根本就不是建立在公平的基础上，所以你很少能够赢得与编辑或评审人的“战争”。</p>

<p>10，最后，我完全明白，在目前的中国，论文发表数量是最重要的。这一点，加上惩罚措施相对缺失，触发了各种各样的异常行为和学术不端行为。然而，如果中国打算取得她应有的国际地位，早晚有一天必须遵守国际学术惯例和学术传统。对量的强调很快就会过去，如果你屈服于眼前的这些短期利益的刺激的话，将来会后悔不迭的。（科学网 梅进译 何姣校）</p>

    <link href="http://secdr.github.io/2015/12/12/elsevierqi-kan-tou-gao-zhuang-tai/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-12T16:58:08+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://secdr.github.io/2015/12/12/elsevierqi-kan-tou-gao-zhuang-tai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>1 关于Elsevier旗下期刊投稿概述</h3>

<p>(1) Elsevier旗下共有1300多种期刊。投稿时采用的是Elsevier Editorial System (EES)投稿系统</p>

<p>(2) 审稿时间。通常不会超过半年，如果半年时间到，部分审稿意见没有返回，期刊社同样会把已返回的意见返回给你。</p>

<p>(3) 版权问题。一般会通过给你发几个PDF合同，然后你打印出来，用手填写，然后邮寄或者扫描后通过email发给他们。</p>

<p>(4) 投稿模板。通常很多人都会关心这个问题，这是投稿的第一步。但是Elsevier旗下期刊对投稿的模板没什么要求，只要
你比较注意排版，看着舒服就好。至于排版，录用后他们编辑会排版，然后让你来校正。建议，投稿时候不要考虑纸张页数，国外期刊不太关心期刊页数，只要按他们最后的排版不超过30页（好像是30页）一般不会收钱。</p>

<p>(5) 如果投稿论文分成几个部分，在投稿的时候就要分开，按照单独的论文投稿。不过要在Letter to Editor中要说明这是同一个论文。</p>

<p>(6) Elsevier旗下期刊投稿不收取审稿费，发表也不收取版面费，但超过一定页数会适当收取费用，如果用彩色印刷，也会收钱，他们不收则以，一收就比较多。</p>

<p>(7) 投稿时是否需要把图片和论文主题分开。这个本来不需要说的，网站上的要求就是如此，需要单独分开上传，但是以我的经验，如果论文图太多，特别是对于国内的网速慢，上传很不方便，可以直接把图放在论文中间，审稿阶段不用考虑图文分开，等录用后再图文分开。</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>2 Elsevier投稿状态总结</h3>

<p>(1) Submitted to Journal</p>

<p>刚提交的状态</p>

<p>(2) Manuscript received by Editorial Office</p>

<p>就是你的文章到了编辑手里了，证明投稿成功</p>

<p>(3) With editor　</p>

<p>如果在投稿的时候没有要求选择编辑，就先到主编那，主编会分派给别的编辑。这当中就会有另两个状态：</p>

<pre><code>1) Awaiting Editor Assignment指派责任编辑 
Editor assigned是把你的文章分给一个编辑处理了。
2) Editor Declined Invitation 也可能编辑会拒绝邀请，这就需要重新指定编辑
3) technical check in progress 检查你的文章符不符合期刊投稿要求
</code></pre>

<p>(4) 编辑接手处理后也会有2种状态
    1) Decision Letter Being Prepared 就是编辑没找审稿人就自己决定了，
    2) Reviewer(s) invited 找到审稿人了，就开始审稿</p>

<p>(5) Under review</p>

<p>这应该是一个漫长的等待。当然前面各步骤也可能很慢的，要看编辑的处理情况。如果被邀请审稿人不想审，就会decline，编辑会重新邀请别的审稿人。</p>

<p>(6) Required Reviews Completed</p>

<p>审稿人的意见已上传，审稿结束，等待编辑决定</p>

<p>(7) Evaluating Recommendation</p>

<p>评估审稿人的意见，随后你将收到编辑给你的decision</p>

<p>(8) Minor revision/Major revision</p>

<p>这个时候可以稍微庆祝一下了，问题不大了，因为有修改就有可能。</p>

<p>(9) Revision Submitted to Journal.</p>

<p>又开始了一个循环。</p>

<p>(10) Accepted 文章被接受</p>

<p>如果不要再审，只是小修改，编辑看后会马上显示这个状态，但如果要再审也会有上面的部分状态。一步会比较快，但也有慢的。看杂志的。还有个状态是Rejected。希望不要出现。</p>

<p>(11) Transfer copyright form 签版权协议</p>

<p>(12) uncorrected proof 等待你校对样稿</p>

<p>(13) In Press, Corrected Proof 文章在印刷中，且该清样已经过作者校对</p>

<p>(14) Manuscript Sent to Production 排版</p>

<p>(15) in production 出版中</p>

<p>备注：</p>

<p>　　现在Elsevier的绝大多数期刊，增加了Technical Checking这一关，由专门的Editorial office来审查论文的语言、格式、排版、图片等等，也就是说，审查你的投稿是否符合Guide for Authors中的各项要求。</p>

<p>论文投稿之后，状态是Submitted to Journal，后成为with editor。注意：这里的Editor实际上不是期刊的主编，而是Editorial office里负责论文格式、排版、语言审查的编辑。如果论文通过了技术性审查，状态重新变为Submitted to Journal，表明论文通过了第一关。之后，如果不出意外，论文状态将会再次变成With Editor，这里的Editor才是真正的期刊主编。到了这一步，你的论文才会进入under review状态。需要说明的是，如果你的论文没通过Technical Checking这一关，你的论文就会退回，要求做格式、语言上的修改，然后鼓励你再投。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>博客中已近有一些论文返修的套话，这里再补充一些模板，方便大家返修的时候使用：</p>

<p>Dear Editor，</p>

<p>We would like to thank the editor for giving us a chance to resubmit the paper, and also thank the reviewers for giving us constructive suggestions which would help us both in English and in depth to improve the quality of the paper. Here we submit a new version of our manuscript with the title “………………………”, which has been modified according to the reviewers’ suggestions. Efforts were also made to correct the mistakes and improve the English of the manuscript. We mark all the changes in red in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>XXX</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The following is a point-to-point response to the two reviewers’ comments.</p>

<h3>Reviewer #1:</h3>

<p>General comments:</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The paper presents an interesting experimental investigation to assess the photocatalytic degradation of polyethylene plastic with goethite under UV irradiation. The research work is clearly presented but the conclusions, the introduction and other parts of the paper relate the results obtained with unjustified claims about the impact of the work. In addition, the background information provided in the introduction part needs significant enrichment. In particular:</p>

<p>Answer: Thank you for the comments on the paper. We have revised the manuscript as suggested since we consider that some sentences or descriptions in the Conclusion part are not so accurate based on the results.  Page 3, line 46: recycling is not available…</p>

<p>Even though a large amount of agricultural plastic waste in burnt or buried in the fields, some quantities of specific categories of good quality agricultural plastic waste are recycled in several countries while research efforts and projects are in progress to improve the corresponding percentage. The authors should refer to the corresponding recent literature.</p>

<p>Answer:Yes. Your opinions inspired us and we revised the manuscript accordingly. In the revised paper, the sentence “Recycling is not available for economy,” was changed to “In order to reduce costs, the thickness of application agriculture films in some regions in China is less than 0.005 mm result in diffcult to recycle, And because the process of recycling is expensive and time-consuming, only a small percentage of the agricultural plastic waste is currently recycled at the end of cultivation in China ”(Page 3 line 49-52).
Page 3, line 76: biodegradable and photodegradable….</p>

<p>There are developments in the area of biodegradable materials that indicate the opposite. Concerning photodegradable materials, they are not considered to represent a solution as they have not been proven to be biodegradable. The authors should refer to the corresponding recent literature.</p>

<p>Answer: Thank you for reminding us the improper description on the study. We have the improper parts revised accordingly and hope that this new manuscript will be convincing ( Page 3 line 52-55).
Page 4, line 65: find an eco-friendly….</p>

<p>The best eco-friendly disposal for agricultural plastic waste is recycling and for non-recyclable materials, energy recovery. Degrading materials produced from fossil sources is not an eco-friendly disposal! The authors should refer to the corresponding recent literature.</p>

<p>Answer: Thank the reviewer for the comments. We’ve recognized that some of the descriptions in the previous copy were really not so accurate and a little bit arbitrary due to our poor English level and the study on recent literature. After consulting more references, we therefore revised paper to be more reasonable and convincing.
Page 4, line 66: to carbon dioxide and water….</p>

<p>Conversion of fossil oil based materials into carbon dioxide and water is much worse than converting renewable-based materials into carbon dioxide and water</p>

<p>Answer: Thank the reviewer for the comments. We’ve recognized that this description in the previous copy were not accurate, due to our poor study on recent literature. The sentence “it is very important to find an eco-friendly disposal of plastic waste where they degrade to carbon dioxide and water under the sunlight irradiation without producing toxic byproducts.” has been deleted.
Page 6, line 112: volatile products….</p>

<p>Define the products.</p>

<p>Answer: We have defined the volatile products in Page 6 line 124-125.
Page 9, line 185: eco-friendly disposal….</p>

<p>The claims of the authors that this technique is an eco-friendly one are not justified. The conclusions and other parts of the paper need to be rewritten and limit the scope of the presented research work to the technical objectives without deriving unjustified general conclusions and claims about the impact of this work.</p>

<p>Answer: Thank the reviewer for the comments. We’ve recognized that this description in the previous copy were not accurate. The sentence “The development of this kind of composite polymer can lead to an eco-friendly disposal of polymer wastes.” was changed to “The present paper intends to study goethite as photocatalytst for degradating plastic. Further attention could be focused on the application of the technique.” (Page 9 line 192-194).</p>

<h3>Reviewer #2:</h3>

<p>/1. Title and abstract should indicate that the work has been done with PE-Goethite composite film.</p>

<p>Answer: Your suggestion is greatly appreciated. We agree and therefore change the title to: Solid-phase photocatalytic degradation of polyethylene–goethite composite film under UV-light irradiation.</p>

<p>/2. Please revise the first paragraph of &lsquo;Introduction&rsquo;.  It is difficult to understand.  In general, the language of the paper should be revisited.</p>

<p>Answer: The Introduction part has been rewritten both in contents and in English. We particularly revised some sentences since they are not correct or so confusing.</p>

<p>/3. Materials and methods - Details of the chemicals to be furnished</p>

<p>Answer: The reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and the details of the chemicals has been shown in Page 4 line 79-83.</p>

<p>/4. Characterization are required for PE (Molecular weight, grade) and Goethite prepared (particle size, BET surface area, SEM-EDS and XRD)</p>

<p>Answer: The reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and the characterization for PE has been shown in Page 4 line 79. The Goethite prepared (particle size, BET surface area, SEM and XRD) has been reported by Liao et al. (2007), We clarify that in the revised manuscript in Page 5 line 91-93.</p>

<p>/5. A schematic diagram of the experimental set up to be given</p>

<p>Answer: The reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and a schematic diagram of the experimental has been given in Fig. 1 in the present paper. The original Fig. 1. was changed to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.</p>

<p>/6. Results - A rate equation should be proposed from the time-weight data</p>

<p>Answer: The reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and the rate equation a schematic diagram of the experimental has been given in Table. 1in the present paper.</p>

<p>/7. A few data are required to show the influence of process parameters such as goethite loading, intensity of UV radiation.</p>

<p>Answer: Reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and the influence of goethite loading has been shown in Fig. 2 in the present paper. And the influence of intensity of UV radiation has been shown in Fig. 3 in the present paper. The original Fig. 2 was changed to Fig. 4 and The original Fig. 3 was changed to Fig. 5 in the present paper.</p>

<p>/8. Until other intermediates are isolated, upto Eqn.(7) (line 162) is sufficient.</p>

<p>Answer: Reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and We changed the Eqns as recommended. Eqs. (8)-(12) are deleted and Eqn.(7) was change to “–(CH2CH2)– + .OH → degradationproducts” (Page 9 line 184).</p>

<p>/9. Figure 3 and 4: 3 pairs are required, namely (i) Only PE film before and after irradiation, (ii) PE-Goethite film (0.4wt %) - before and after irradiation (iii) PE-Goethite film (1.0 wt %) - before and after irradiation.</p>

<p>Answer: Reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and the original Fig. 3 and 4 was changed to Fig .5 in the present paper.</p>

<p>/10. Point 3 above is also applicable for SEM photographs. Please rearrange and clearly mark the difference between the films before and after irradiation for both SEM and FTIR results.</p>

<p>Answer: Thank the reviewer and editor’s for the comments. During the revision of the paper, we did a supplementary experiment got some new SEM photographs, which has been shown in Fig. 4 in the present paper. And The FTIR results has been rearranged in Fig.5 in the present paper, respectively.</p>

<p>/11. It should be clearly mentioned in the conclusion that the degradation was more when goethite loading and intensity of light both were more</p>

<p>Answer: The reviewer and editor’s suggestions have been adopted and the conclusions has been changed in Page 9 line 192-198.</p>
