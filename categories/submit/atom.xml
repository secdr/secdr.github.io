    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1、 什么是cover letter？</p>

<p>指的是投稿信</p>

<p>2、cover letter的内容主要包括那些？</p>

<p>应该简述所投稿件的核心内容、主要发现和意义，拟投期刊，对稿件处理有无特殊要求等（如“not to review” list）。另外，请附上主要作者的中文姓名、通讯地址、电话、传真和e-mail地址。此外有的杂志要求推荐几位审稿人及其联系方式。以及谁已经阅读过该文（当然是牛人）。
我投的那个杂志是要求说明你论文研究的意义，以及与这个杂志的相关性，另外还有的可能要写明你没有一搞多投等。此外临床实验要求写明符合伦理学要求。</p>

<p>3、 如何写cover letter？</p>

<p>各个杂志的具体要求是不一样的，在杂志的guide for authors一般会有要求。如果没有具体的要求，大家可按照通用要求处理。</p>

<pre><code>Dear Editor,

We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled "GDNF Acutely Modulates Neuronal Excitability and A-type Potassium Channels in Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons", which we wish to be considered for publication in Nature Neuroscience. 

GDNF has long been thought to be a potent neurotrophic factor for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which are degenerated in Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we report an unexpected, acute effect of GDNF on A-type potassium channels, leading to a potentiation of neuronal excitability, in the dopaminergic neurons in culture as well as in adult brain slices. Further, we show that GDNF regulates the K+ channels through a mechanism that involves activation of MAP kinase. Thus, this study has revealed, for the first time, an acute modulation of ion channels by GDNF. Our findings challenge the classic view of GDNF as a long-term survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and suggest that the normal function of GDNF is to regulate neuronal excitability, and consequently dopamine release. These results may also have implications in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. 

Due to a direct competition and conflict of interest, we request that Drs. XXX of Harvard Univ., and YY of Yale Univ. not be considered as reviewers. With thanks for your consideration, I am

Dear Sirs,
I am sending herewith a copy of the manuscript, which I would like to submit to SOLA, the Electronic Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan.
The paper is entitled:
Energy Spectrum Proportional to the Squared Phase Speed of
Rossby Modes in the General Circulation of the Atmosphere
by H. L. Tanaka, Yasushi Watarai, and Takahiro Kanda.
Copy of the Abstract:
In this study, energy spectrum of the large-scale atmospheric motions is examined in the framework of the 3D normal mode decomposition. The horizontal scale of disturbance is measured by the phase speed of a Rossby mode c. According to the analysis result for the barotropic component of the atmosphere, we obtain a characteristic energy spectrum with distinct slopes for the turbulence and wave regimes separated by the spherical Rhines speed. In order to explain the observational finding that the energy spectrum is proportional to c^2, we put forward a hypothesis based on the criterion of Rossby wave breaking such that the local meridional gradient of potential vorticity becomes negative, dq/dy &lt; 0, somewhere in the domain. With a constant m describing a total mass of the atmosphere for unit area, we have shown that the barotropic energy spectrum of the general circulation E can be represented as E=mc^2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>又总结了一部分万能的开场白，足以体现我们对杂志社编辑和审稿人的尊重。</p>

<p>1、It is with excitement that I resubmit to you a revised version of manuscript “文章题目” for the &ldquo;杂志名&rdquo;. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to revise and resubmit this manuscript. In keeping with my last communication with you, I am resubmitting this revision before the agreed upon deadline, March 16, 2012. I appreciate the time and detail provided by each reviewer and by you and have incorporated the suggested changes into the manuscript to the best of my ability. The manuscript has certainly benefited from these insightful revision suggestions. I look forward to working with you and the reviewers to move this manuscript closer to publication in the 杂志名. （这段拍马屁的写得真长哇，憋不出来的可以参考下）</p>

<p>2、I have responded specifically to each suggestion below, beginning with your own. To make the changes easier to identify where necessary, I have numbered them.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>3、I am pleased to resubmit for publication the revised version of 文章在杂志社的编号 “文章题目”. I appreciated the constructive criticisms of the Associate Editor and the reviewers. I have addressed each of their concerns as outlined below. （这样的开场白简单点）</p>

<p>4、Sincerest thanks for your response and reviewers comments on our manuscript. We sincerely apologise for the great time it has taken us to respond to these comments (due to force majeaure with first author), and hope that a revised version of the manuscript will still be considered by 杂志名. We have modified the paper in response to the extensive and insightful reviewer comments. We have added additional explanations for non-haematologists and additional table (Table 1) to fully address the reviewer’s comments. Furthermore we have rewritten sections of the manuscript and we hope that this comply with the referee’s remarks. We will respond to the comments point counter point. （这段挺长的，还就返修时间过长进行了致歉）</p>

<p>5、Thank you for reading our manuscript and reviewing it, which will help us improve it to a better scientific level. We revised our manuscript, and quite a lot of changes have taken place. So we have sent the revised manuscript, and a version containing all the changes to be visible.</p>

<p>At the following, the points mentioned by the reviewers will be discussed: (其实我比较喜欢这种简单直白的开场）</p>

<p>6、The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their time and their valuable comments. Before addressing each of the comments below, we would like to make a general remark regarding the intent of the manuscript and the choice of the journal.</p>

<p>We chose &ldquo;XX杂志社&rdquo; because it is an applied journal publishing papers that will help clinical medical physicists perform their responsibilities more effectively and efficiently, and for the increased benefit of the patient. We feel that this journal is appropriate for our manuscript that we intend to be a practical paper which is helpful for a hospital physicist.</p>

<p>We deliberately went into more details in parts of the introduction and the methods section explaining specifics of CBCT, since the target audience might not be interested in the more fundamental papers in other journals covering the topic. We obviously need to quote all sources correctly and will do so at the places where we had missed before. （让我亮瞎眼的拍马屁，想抄的尽管抄）</p>

<p>7、Please find enclosed the response to the comments of reviewers. The manuscript has been carefully revised in response to the reviewers’comments and suggestions; detailed responses to their comments are below. Our reply is in italic font, whereas the reviewers’ specific comments are not italicized. We thank the reviewers for their suggestions, which have significantly improved this m/s.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>审稿人也是人，不要无故地增加他们的痛苦，今天来讲一讲写response letter有哪些注意事项。</p>

<h3>Do&rsquo;s</h3>

<ol>
<li>与从事相关领域的朋友、导师或师兄师姐讨论，听取他们的意见（在医院的小伙伴就不用试这一条了，多半不是没人理就是白讨论，个人意见，勿拍);</li>
<li>完整地地回复审稿人的意见，不要遗漏任何问题；</li>
<li>如果你不同意审稿人的意见，请保持礼貌；</li>
<li>如果需要，可以引用参考文献或未发表的数据来支持自己的观点；</li>
<li>不要拖沓，收到返修后要尽快写回复，并且把改过的地方标识出来。</li>
</ol>


<h3>Don’ts</h3>

<ol>
<li>不要跟审稿人争论每一个问题，在一些无关紧要的小细节上，在并不影响文章价值的前提下，让一让审稿人；</li>
<li>不要把审稿人的批评当做是个人攻击；</li>
<li>如果审稿人要看原始数据，不要拒绝；</li>
<li>不要使用“we completely disagree”、“the referee obviously does not know this field”这样的话，会伤了审稿人的心。</li>
</ol>


<!--more-->


<p>可以使用委婉在回复，如下：</p>

<pre><code>We agree with the referee that……,but
The referee is right to point out….,yet
In accordance with the referees’wishes,we have now changed this sentence to…
Whilst we agree with the referee that……..
It is true that…,but
We acknowledge that our paper might have been…., but
We too were disappointed by the low response rate…
We agree that this is an important area that requires furthr research…..
We support the referee's assertion that….,although
With all due respect to the reviewer,we felt that this point is  not correct…
</code></pre>

<h3>文章几种状态的应对方法：</h3>

<p>Accept with minor revision</p>

<p>如果你很幸运，只要小修，这种情况下，不要argue太多，速度改了回复给杂志社，在主编还对你的文章有所印象时，速度返修往往也是速度接收。</p>

<p>Major revisions needed</p>

<p>这种情况下，有三条黄金原则：礼貌、完整、证据。不要低估大修的工作量，可以需要好几天铺在此事上。如果是大修，看上去没有什么接收的希望，也不要放弃，有些作者就这样放弃然后一字不改地投到别的杂志去，同领域的专家就那么几个，搞不好你的文章又送给同一个审稿人，华丽丽地忽视了他的意见，他会很不高兴的。即使改投杂志，也要根据上一本杂志的返修意见好好修改完文章后再投。</p>

<p>Journal requests a complete rewrite</p>

<p>这种情况下，你要好好思量下重新写文章是否值得。如果审稿人和主编告诉了你要如何改这篇文章，表示杂志社还是想要你的文章的，如果你照办了，拒绝你是要下多大狠心。但是如果审稿人只是冷冰冰的让你重写文章，没有给具体的建设性的意见，最好改投杂志，也许投入和产出不成正比。</p>

<p>Unsure if reject or possible resubmission?</p>

<p>比如这样的审稿意见“ we cannot accept your paper in its current form, but if you do decide to resubmit, then we would only consider a substantial revision”好像是个拒绝的言辞，但是又不确定，又好像是再给一次机会。这种情况下最好写邮件给杂志社，问问他们到底是如何想的，然后再决定，自个人揣测杂志社的意思不如写封邮件。</p>

<p>The outright rejection</p>

<p>如果你确实很想在这本杂志发文章，那么可以写信给杂志社，要求换责任主编再审，前提是你有足够的自信，当然希望是很渺茫的，好吧，希望是非常渺茫的。另一种告诉就是别再哭鼻子了，赶紧再投别的杂志吧，投之前请按照拒稿意见好好地修改你的文章，避免因为同样的问题被拒稿。</p>

<p>如果审稿人错了如何办？</p>

<p>审稿人不是上帝，也会犯错误。有时他们只是不仔细，你懂的，有可能是学生审的，不要写成“if the referee had bothered to read our paper” 之类的，可以写“we agree that this is an important point and we have already addressed it on page A, paragraph B, line C”.有时就是审稿人犯二了，附和他们是一件很傻的事情，这时候，把证据列出来就好了，杂志社主编会还你一个公道。</p>

<p>如果审稿人对你有歧视如何办？</p>

<p>这时候给杂志社写邮件，抱怨下这个问题，并要求重新送审。</p>

<p>The dreaded “reduce the paper by 30%” request（以及类似这种情况）</p>

<p>这个过程还是很痛苦的，因为你会觉得丢弃任何一部分都很心痛，这时候可以找个朋友来帮忙（针对有选择障碍的小伙伴），看下哪一部分的内容要去掉，另外，温馨提示，前言和讨论是比较好删字的地方。</p>

<h3>例 6：</h3>

<p>Dear editors,</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind comments on our manuscript entitled “XX 文章名”. We have
carefully revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s comments. Based on the
suggestions, we have made an extensive modification on the revised manuscript.
Detailed revision was shown as follows. The changes to our manuscript within the
document were aslo highlighted by using red colored text.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As to the related articles published in Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,
we have always been reading the latest papers that were published in APJCP. In fact, several high-quality papers arouse us great interest before we drafted our manuscript. From our intensive reading of these papers published in APJCP, we get better understanding of the hotspots in breast cancer research. We also get a
wider view of the regulatory networks that contribute to XXXX. For example, one
paper entitled “XXXX” showed that metastasis-related molecules could be
regulated by microRNAs in human tumor metastasis process. This paper led us to
hypothesize that XXX, a metastasis-associated protein, might also be linked to
microRNA regulations in breast cancer. Hence, this paper provided a novel clue
for us to uncover the mechanisms underlying XXXX cancer metastasis. Based on
all these instructive papers, we have herein added these references to our article in
the revised version (please see P6, Line 15; P12, Line17; P14, Line 21-22; P15,
Line 1-4).</p></li>
<li><p>For the reference format within the article, we are sorry for our incorrect citation
format. And in this revised version, we have checked carefully of all the citations.
All citations within the article were formatted into “Family Name et al., Year” for
over two-author papers, or “Family Name, Year” for only one-author papers.</p></li>
<li><p>For the reference format after the text, we also feel sorry for our carelessness.
Previously, we didn’t notice the special format of APJCP. In the revised version,
we have corrected all the reference formats to meet the requirements of APJCP.
All the detailed corrections could be seen in the Reference section in which
changes were marked by red.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Thank you again for your positive comments on our manuscript. APJCP is an
influential journal which aims to improve our understanding of cancer prevention.
From all the papers published in your journal, readers have been learning a lot.
Hopefully, we could have our article been considered of publication in your
journal. Should there been any other corrections we could make, please feel free
to contact us.</p>
