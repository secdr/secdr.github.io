4、Sincerest thanks for your response and reviewers comments on our manuscript. We sincerely apologise for the great time it has taken us to respond to these comments (due to force majeaure with first author), and hope that a revised version of the manuscript will still be considered by 杂志名.

6、The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their time and their valuable comments. Before addressing each of the comments below, we would like to make a general remark regarding the intent of the manuscript and the choice of the journal.

We chose "XX杂志社" because it is an applied journal publishing papers that will help clinical medical physicists perform their responsibilities more effectively and efficiently, and for the increased benefit of the patient. We feel that this journal is appropriate for our manuscript that we intend to be a practical paper which is helpful for a hospital physicist.

We deliberately went into more details in parts of the introduction and the methods section explaining specifics of CBCT, since the target audience might not be interested in the more fundamental papers in other journals covering the topic. We obviously need to quote all sources correctly and will do so at the places where we had missed before. （让我亮瞎眼的拍马屁，想抄的尽管抄）

7、Please find enclosed the response to the comments of reviewers. The manuscript has been carefully revised in response to the reviewers’comments and suggestions; detailed responses to their comments are below. Our reply is in italic font, whereas the reviewers’ specific comments are not italicized. We thank the reviewers for their suggestions, which have significantly improved this m/s.
