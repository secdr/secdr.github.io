### Introduction 

1. This will be followed by a description of thefuzzy nature of the problem and a detailed presentation of how the requiredmembership functions are defined. 
2. Details on xx and xx are discussed in latersections. 
3. In the next section, after a statement of thebasic problem, various situations involving possibility knowledge areinvestigated: first, an entirely possibility model is proposed; then the casesof a fuzzy service time with stochastic arrivals and non fuzzy service rule isstudied; lastly, fuzzy service rule are considered.
